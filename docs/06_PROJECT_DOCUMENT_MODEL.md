## 1. Why This Domain Exists  {#PROJ-WHY}
Until this specification the application could not save work. The only state that reached disk was
`recovery_v2.json`, which answers *"the app died, what was on screen?"* — a crash artefact, not a
document. Closing the app deliberately destroyed the session: an hour of markers, cuts, speed ramps,
zooms and meme placements lived only in the live window.

A `.fvsproj` file is the user's work. It is the one artefact in this product whose loss cannot be
regenerated from anything else, which is why the rules below are stricter than elsewhere.

---

## 2. The Document Is The Inputs, Never The Outputs  {#PROJ-INPUTS}
`ProjectDocument` stores exactly the input surface of `OutputTimeline.Create` plus the settings that
decide how those chunks render. Nothing derived is ever written to the file.

* **PROJ_01 — Completeness test.** `BuildTimeline()` reconstructs the authoritative timeline from
  the document alone. If a field is needed to rebuild the finished video and is not in the document,
  that is a silent data-loss bug; if a field is not needed, it does not belong.
* ⚠ **NORTH STAR #2 APPLIES.** No cached `TotalOutputSeconds`. Storing a derived duration creates a
  second answer to "how long is the video", which goes stale the moment the maths is corrected in a
  later build — and is then believed over the real model. `SourceClip.DurationMs` is the one measured
  value stored, and it is a property of the FILE, not of the edit.
* ⚠ **NORTH STAR #3 APPLIES.** `ProjectAudio.MusicVolume` and `VideoVolume` are EXPORT mix levels and
  belong in the document. The master PREVIEW volume is a property of this machine's playback session
  and must never be stored — saving it would carry one machine's monitoring level into another
  machine's export, exactly the coupling that invariant forbids.
* **PROJ_04 — One way in.** `BuildTimeline()` is the only sanctioned route from a loaded project to a
  timeline. A screen that re-derives chunks from its own copies of these lists re-introduces the
  duplicated-maths defect `OutputTimeline`'s own header documents.

---

## 3. Schema Versioning & The Amputation Rule  {#PROJ-SCHEMA}
* **PROJ_02 — Two numbers.** `SchemaVersion` is what this build WRITES. `MinimumReadableSchemaVersion`
  is the oldest it can still READ. Bump `SchemaVersion` only when the MEANING of an existing field
  changes; adding a new optional field needs no bump, because the reader tolerates missing keys.
* **A file from the future is refused, in words.** A schema above `SchemaVersion` is rejected with a
  message naming both numbers and telling the user to update. Reading it on a best-effort basis would
  reinterpret fields whose meaning changed and hand back a montage they did not author.
* **PROJ_03 — THE AMPUTATION RULE (non-negotiable).** Unrecognised top-level keys are captured into
  `ProjectDocument.UnknownFields` and written back out verbatim. Without this, opening a v2 file in a
  v1 build and saving it silently deletes every v2 field. The user performed one ordinary
  open-and-save and lost work the newer build could have read. Unknown keys are emitted FIRST on
  write so a known key always wins a collision.
* **The reader is forgiving; the writer is explicit.** Every `Read*` helper absorbs a missing key, an
  explicit null and a wrong JSON type. Hand-edited and half-written files exist, and an exception
  thrown from deep inside a load is indistinguishable, to the user, from the app losing their work.
  A project that opens with one setting reset is worth infinitely more than a project that refuses
  to open. Malformed list entries (a meme with no path or no id, a cut with no end) are dropped, not
  carried as half-placements the user cannot see or delete.

---

## 4. No Reflection. Ever.  {#PROJ-AOT}
* **PROJ_02 — Hand-written mapping is mandatory.** The product ships NativeAOT with `TrimMode=full`.
  Reflection-based `System.Text.Json` compiles, passes in Debug, and throws `NotSupportedException`
  only in the published .exe on the user's machine. `ProjectSerializer` touches nothing but
  `JsonNode` / `JsonObject`. Source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` (as `Ipc/IpcProtocol.cs` uses)
  is the only acceptable alternative. `JsonSerializer.Serialize(document)` is forbidden here.
* **AOTSAFETY_01 — The analysers stay on.** `SuppressTrimAnalysisWarnings` and
  `SuppressAotAnalysisWarnings` are `false` in `FreeVideoStudio.App.csproj`, and `IL2104` is
  no longer in `NoWarn`. Setting them back to `true` does not make the app AOT-safe; it makes the app
  silent about not being AOT-safe. These are warnings, not errors — the build still succeeds. Each
  one is fixed or annotated at the call site with a reason. `IlcTrimMetadata` is a separate
  size/behaviour switch, is unrelated, and stays `false`.

### What the analysers caught the moment they were switched back on
Every item below is a REAL finding that was invisible while the suppressions were `true`. None was
fixed by muting it again — the rule is fix, or annotate one statement with a reason.

* **AOTSAFETY_02 — `JsonArray.Add<T>(T)` (13 call sites).** The generic overload carries
  `RequiresUnreferencedCode`/`RequiresDynamicCode` because `T` could be an arbitrary POCO. Passing a
  `JsonNode` never reflects, but C# picks the generic anyway: `JsonArray` implements
  `ICollection<JsonNode?>.Add` EXPLICITLY, so the safe non-generic overload is invisible on the type.
  `Infrastructure/AotJson.AddNode` casts to the interface and binds to the unannotated method.
  ⚠ Use `AddNode`, never a `#pragma`: the extension makes the safety PROVABLE, where a suppression
  merely asserts it and goes on hiding the next call — possibly one that really does pass a POCO.
* **`Marshal.SizeOf(Type)`** in `HardwareTelemetrySampler.GetMemUsage` — a separate fix, not the
  `AOTSAFETY_03` tag: that tag's sentinel (`build/sentinels.txt`) is the release analyser policy in
  `FreeVideoStudio.App.csproj` (§10), even though this call site's code comment reuses the
  label. Asks the runtime to build marshalling code for a reflectively-known type, which does not exist after AOT
  compilation. `Marshal.SizeOf<T>()` is computed at compile time and yields the identical size.
* **AOTSAFETY_04 — `SettingsManager.Save` was on the reflection path.** It already had a
  source-generated `SettingsJsonContext` AND assigned it as `TypeInfoResolver`, yet still called
  `JsonSerializer.Serialize<TValue>(TValue, JsonSerializerOptions)` — an overload that stays
  annotated regardless of the resolver, because it cannot prove which resolver arrives at run time.
  Now passes the generated `JsonTypeInfo` directly (`IndentedContext.AppSettings`), cached in a
  static because a context allocates a full options graph and `Save()` runs on every change.
  This is the shape to copy: having a context is not the same as USING it.
* **AOTSAFETY_05 — `X509Certificate.CreateFromSignedFile` (SYSLIB0057).** The only suppression in the
  codebase, scoped to one statement with the reason recorded. The obsoletion points at
  `X509CertificateLoader`, which loads certificate FILES and has no equivalent for extracting an
  embedded signer certificate from a signed PE — which is what SYS-SIGNING needs. Revisit if .NET
  ships a replacement.

---

## 5. Persistence Protocol  {#PROJ-DISK}
* **PROJ_08 — Atomic or nothing.** Every write goes through `AtomicJsonFile.WriteObject`, per
  `05_SYSTEM_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md#SYS-ATOMICWRITE` ("not optional, and it is not per-caller"):
  GUID temp file in the target directory, `FileOptions.WriteThrough`, `Flush(flushToDisk: true)`,
  atomic `File.Move(overwrite: true)`. Never `File.WriteAllText`.
* **AUTOSAVEBG_01 - Autosave disk I/O is non-blocking.** `ProjectSession.AutosaveTick` captures an
  immutable snapshot on the UI thread and performs the atomic write (WriteThrough + hardware flush)
  and the history sidecar on the thread pool. Dirty clears only if no edit landed mid-write; a
  failure is still Fatal. Explicit saves remain synchronous and share one ordered write gate with
  autosave, so an older autosave can never overwrite a newer save. See `05` §4d.
* **One generation of backup.** The previous file becomes `<name>.fvsproj.bak` BEFORE the new bytes
  are written — taken afterwards it would back up the save that just happened. The crop config keeps
  a five-tier cascade because it is machine state the user never sees; a project is different, and a
  folder holding five numbered copies of every montage is its own kind of damage. A zero-length live
  file is never promoted over a good backup. A failed backup never blocks a save.
* **Damaged live file falls back to the backup, and SAYS SO.** `Load` reports `loadedFromBackup`.
  A user shown yesterday's version without being told will keep editing and re-save over the good
  copy.
* **Failure is returned, never thrown.** A save that throws out of a close handler is how an app
  loses the very work the user was protecting. Callers render `ProjectIoResult.Error` into
  "could not save, here is why, your edits are still open" — and per
  `04_UI_UX_AVALONIA_SPEC.md#UI-SAFEGUARDS` (CROPUNSAVED_01) a failed save BLOCKS departure.
* **Extension is normalised on save.** A bare name would produce a file the shell cannot associate
  and the open dialog's filter will not show — which reads to the user as "my save vanished".
* ⚠ **THREADING.** All of `ProjectStore` and `RecentProjects` performs synchronous disk I/O and MUST
  NOT run on the Avalonia dispatcher (North Star #6). Call via `Task.Run`; marshal only the result
  back.

---

## 6. Source Integrity  {#PROJ-INTEGRITY}
* **PROJ_05 — Paths outlive the files they point at.** `CheckSource()` returns `Intact`, `Changed`,
  `Missing` or `Unknown` so the app can say *"that video has been replaced, your cuts may not line
  up"* instead of rendering markers against different footage.
* **Fingerprint, not hash.** Size plus last-write-time stored in whole Unix seconds; a difference of
  up to 2 s is tolerated, more is `Changed`. Hashing a 4 GB
  capture on every open would cost more than the entire load. Small drift is ignored: copying a
  file between filesystems perturbs it without the bytes differing, and a false warning teaches users
  to dismiss the real one.
* **An absent fingerprint is `Unknown`, not `Changed`.** Older projects have no fingerprint, and
  nagging about every one of them trains the warning away.
* **`Missing` never blocks opening.** The project loads so the user can relink.

---

## 7. Recent Projects  {#PROJ-RECENT}
* **PROJ_09 — Saving is only half the feature.** A user who can save but must hunt through Explorer
  has been given a filing chore, not a document model.
* **Capped at `MaxEntries = 10`** — the number a person can recognise in a menu. Longer, and it is a
  second file browser with worse sorting.
* **De-duplicated case-insensitively.** Windows paths differing only in case are the same file;
  showing both reads as the app being confused.
* **Missing files are FLAGGED, NOT DROPPED.** `RecentProject.Exists` lets the UI grey the row and
  explain. A project on an unplugged external drive is not a project the user deleted, and quietly
  removing the row is how a user concludes the app lost their montage. `Prune` runs only when the
  user asks.
* **A damaged recent list is cosmetic.** It must never stop the app starting, and never surface as an
  error to dismiss on every launch.

---

## 8. Open Work Bound To This Spec  {#PROJ-TODO}
The model and its persistence exist and are unit-tested
(`tests/FreeVideoStudio.Core.Tests/ProjectDocumentTests.cs`).

**Closed since this list was written:**

1. ~~`MainWindow` command wiring~~ — done (`PROJSESSION_04`: Ctrl+S / Ctrl+Shift+S / Ctrl+O /
   Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y, with the dirty flag and the unsaved-changes prompt).
2. **`PROJ_10` — the reader was losing the source fingerprint on every load.** `SizeBytes` and
   `ModifiedUtcSeconds` are `long`; the writer stored long-backed `JsonValue`s and the reader asked
   for `double`. `JsonValue.TryGetValue<double>` is an EXACT-TYPE accessor — it returns false on a
   long — so the fallback won and both fields came back **0 on every load**.

   ⚠️ The damage was not the two fields, it was §6: those two fields ARE the integrity fingerprint.
   `CheckSource` compared a real file's size against a stored zero and answered `Changed` for every
   project anyone ever reopened. The warning that exists to say "your source clip was re-encoded"
   fired constantly and therefore meant nothing. **A warning that is always on is a warning that is
   off.** Every numeric read now tries every numeric backing, and `ReadLong` exists because
   `(long)ReadDouble(...)` rounds past 2^53.
3. **`PROJ_11` — the document now carries the HUD mask and the merge queue (schema 2).**
   * The mask was `SettingsManager.ActiveMaskOverlay` plus one machine-wide `crop_coordinates.json`
     and was in the project **nowhere**. A montage saved in March and reopened in May exported
     through whatever mask was active then — different rectangles, a visibly different video — and
     nothing said so. `ProjectMask` stores the profile name, the resolved config AND a content
     fingerprint; the name alone is not enough, because a profile is editable in place.
     Reopening with a different or edited mask raises a **Degraded** fault naming what changed. It
     does **not** silently switch the machine's profile back: that would trade a silent wrong render
     for a silent wrong setting, and reach outside the document to do it.
   * The merge queue lived only in `VideoMergerWindow`'s `ObservableCollection<string>`. Queue eight
     clips, close the Merger, save — and the `.fvsproj` described a single-clip edit. `ProjectMerge`
     records the ordered clips; `ToolNavigator` holds them between windows.

   ⚠️ `ProjectMerge` is also the document's route out of being single-source. `Source` is one clip
   because the main editor edits one clip, and a montage of several was an unrelated feature sharing
   an application. Storing the list here is the precondition for ever treating a multi-clip edit as
   one document.
4. **`PROJ_12` — the merge queue carries the Video Merger's full edit list (schema 3).**
   `ProjectMerge.Edl` is the `MergeEdl` (MERGEEDL_01: windows in source µs, per-clip speed/zoom,
   freezes, memes, thumbnail, music, scraper, base speed), written under `merge.edl` in the EDL's own
   source-generated JSON. `merge.clips` is still written. Read: a valid `edl` wins; a missing or
   corrupt one leaves `Edl` null and `ToEdl()` migrates `clips` (no effects, deterministic clip ids so
   two migrations are equal). The bump to 3 is deliberate: a v2 reader keeps unknown keys only at the
   ROOT, so it would silently drop `merge.edl`; refusing the file is safer than losing effects.
5. **`MERGEUNDO_01` — Video Merger undo/redo over the edit list.** `VideoMergerWindow.History.cs` keeps one
   `UndoStack<MergeEdl>` (U1–U4). It stores `MergerSession.UserEdit(edl)` (analysis fields stripped, so a
   finished background probe is never a step). `MergerSession.DescribeChange` labels each step and gives
   gesture keys (`speed`, `thumb`) so a wheel sweep or a marker drag is ONE step. Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y /
   Ctrl+Shift+Z (not while a TextBox has focus or a MERGE runs). Undo/redo and session restore share
   `ApplyEdlStateAsync`, which reorders the queue in place (`MergerSession.SyncQueue`, never Clear) and
   re-derives music from its clip anchors. `UndoStack.ReplaceCurrent` absorbs the re-capture right after
   an undo so normalisation can never burn the redo branch.
6. **`MEMEMODE_01` — dual-mode memes (schema 4).** Every meme object carries `mode` (`inline` | `corner`),
   `corner` (`top_left` | `top_right` | `bottom_left` | `bottom_right`), `size` (`small` | `medium` | `large`) and
   `sound` (bool), via `MemePresentationJson`. All optional on read: a file at schema 1–3 (no keys) reads every meme
   as full screen, bottom right, medium, with sound — exactly what it always was. The bump to 4 is deliberate: the
   keys live INSIDE a meme object, where a v3 reader keeps no unknown keys, so it would read a corner overlay as a
   longer, full-screen video and drop the keys on save. The recovery document (RECOVERYDOC_01) and the editor's
   session JSON use the same mapping; the Merger EDL carries the same four fields on `EdlMeme` (`FromJson` fills
   them on older files, EDLNULL_01). Equality (UNDOEQ_01) covers them, so each change is an undo step.
7. ~~Title-bar dirty indicator~~ — done (`PROJSESSION_05`: `MainWindow.RefreshProjectTitle` appends
   " •" to the project name while `ProjectSession.IsDirty`).

**Still not done:**

1. ~~`RecoveryManager` demoted to autosave OF THIS DOCUMENT rather than a parallel state format.~~
   **Done (RECOVERYDOC_01..12).** The crash-recovery file now holds exactly ONE `ProjectDocument`
   — captured by `ProjectSession.Capture(forExplicitSave: false)`, serialised by the canonical
   `ProjectSerializer` inside `Core/Project/RecoveryEnvelope.cs` (`fvsrecovery` envelope: one
   `project` + crash-only `transient` metadata) — and is applied back through
   `ProjectSession.OpenDocument`, the same document-application path Open Project uses. The old
   hand-rolled 60-field recovery payload (`SerializeState`) and the field-by-field restore in
   `MainWindow.Restore.cs` are gone; legacy `schemaVersion:1` payloads are migrated one-way by
   `App/Services/LegacyRecoveryMigrator.cs` (limitation: the legacy schema never carried the mask
   or the merger queue). Atomic writes, the WRITEORDER_01 ordering, the granular-session
   preservation merge and the 750 ms write-behind debounce are unchanged.
2. `.fvsproj` shell association and icon (`ShellFileAssociation.cs`), plus open-with launch.
3. Publishing and applying the app-only update (`09` §3 DIST-SPLIT). `Staging.CreatePayloadZip` now produces `obj/ReleaseAssets/FreeVideoStudio.App.update.zip` and embeds the runtime manifest in the full payload. Uploading the sidecars, applying the app-only archive and excluding the app from the runtime fingerprint remain unfinished.

---

## 9. The Close-Path Save Guard  {#PROJ-CLOSEGUARD}

* **`PROJSESSION_08` — "dirty" is a CONJUNCTION, and the second half belongs to the application.**
  A session-local dirty bit says *"an edit happened since the last save"*. Nothing about exporting
  writes a `.fvsproj`, so that bit stays true forever after a render and the user was asked to save
  a video they had just finished.
  `MainWindow.HasUnsavedWork()` already answers the real question and answers it better: it returns
  false when the clip has just been exported (`ExportedCleanSinceLastEdit`), when no clip is loaded,
  and when every edit is still at its default. The tool-switch prompt has consulted it all along
  (`SWITCHPROMPT_01`). The session now requires **both**, so a finished render prompts for nothing,
  on close or on the way to the Merger and Crop Tools.
  * ⚠️ Ignoring it reintroduced, one layer up, the exact wrong-state defect the
    `_exportedCleanSinceLastEdit` flag was added to fix.

* **`PROJSESSION_09` — THE GUARD MUST NEVER TRAP THE USER IN THEIR OWN APPLICATION.**
  It runs from `OnClosing`, which has already set `e.Cancel = true`, and `OnClosing` is `async void`.
  If the guard returns false or throws, `_isSafeToClose` is never set, `Close()` is never re-posted,
  and the next click on X repeats the whole thing. **The application cannot be closed.**
  Two ways that happened, both now closed:
  1. **An interactive Save As on the close path.** A never-saved project fell through to the file
     picker, and a picker cannot open on a window that is mid-close: it returns null, the guard
     reported "not saved" and refused the close. The user pressed **Save** and the app would not shut
     down. `SaveForExitAsync` never shows a dialog — it writes beside the source clip under a
     non-colliding name derived from it, and says where it went.
  2. **An unguarded throw.** The whole body is now wrapped, and the failure direction is deliberate:
     a broken dialog lets the close **proceed**. Losing an unsaved `.fvsproj` is bad; an application
     that needs Task Manager to quit is worse, and the crash-recovery snapshot (`05` §4 SYS-RECOVERY)
     still holds the session either way.

---

## 10. Release Analyser Policy (AOTCLEAN_01, supersedes AOTSAFETY_03)  {#PROJ-AOTPOLICY}
`AOTSAFETY_03` here is the tag registered in `build/sentinels.txt` (it resolves to
`FreeVideoStudio.App.csproj`); the `Marshal.SizeOf<T>()` fix in §4 is a different change.
* **Zero trim/AOT warnings. Nothing muted, nothing collapsed, nothing made non-fatal.** `Staging.Publish` runs with `-p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`; every IL2xxx/IL3xxx from ANY assembly fails the release.
* The interim AOTSAFETY_03 rule (third-party `TrimmerSingleWarn`, `WarningsNotAsErrors=IL2104;IL3053`, IL2026 muted at the ILC stage) is REMOVED. Each finding was fixed at its source:
  | Finding | Source | Fix |
  |---|---|---|
  | IL2026 ×2, IL3050 ×3 | Avalonia 11.0.10 (`ObservableStreamPlugin`, `MethodAccessorPlugin`, composition `Expression`, `SkiaMetalApi`) | Avalonia **11.3.22** (same major) |
  | IL2091 ×2 | SkiaSharp 2.88 (`SKObject.PtrToStructure<T>`) | SkiaSharp **3.119.2** with native-asset overrides (supported on Avalonia ≥ 11.3.6). `TextOverlayGenerator` moved to `SKFont` (AOTCLEAN_04) |
  | IL2050 ×2, IL2070, WaveHeaderUnprepared | NAudio umbrella → NAudio.Wasapi `MediaFoundationReader` (classic COM interop: unsupported by NativeAOT, would throw); WinMM 2.3.0 WAVEHDR marshaling under NativeAOT | **NAudio.Core + NAudio.WinMM 3.1.0 only** (native unmanaged structs for WaveIn/WaveOut, AOT compatible); `AudioFileReader` replaced by `Core/Media/WavAudioReader` (AOTCLEAN_02, MICHEALTH_01) |
  | IL2067, IL2072 | Vortice 3.8.3 → SharpGen.Runtime reflection vtable registry | Vortice removed; `App/Interop/D3D11Interop.cs` makes the six D3D11/DXGI calls through verified vtable slots (AOTCLEAN_03) |
* Side effect: the NAudio umbrella's WinForms dependency is gone, so the App no longer needs `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App`.
* Avalonia 11.3 obsoletions migrated (no suppression): `DragEventArgs.Data` → `DataTransfer`, `DataFormats.Files` → `DataFormat.File`, `DoDragDrop` → `DoDragDropAsync` with an application-private `DataFormat<string>`, `RadialGradientBrush.Radius` → `RadiusX/RadiusY` (same relative value).
* `Avalonia.Diagnostics` is referenced in Debug only (DevTools is `#if DEBUG`). `Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid` and `.ColorPicker` stay removed.
* **ILCCRASH_01 — ILC's own crash is not a code failure.** ILC 9.0.x can crash internally (`IL1013` / `NullReferenceException` in `XNodeNavigator` while the parallel scanner reads a framework assembly's embedded `ILLink.Substitutions.xml`, dotnet/runtime#108743). `Staging.Publish` recognises that signature and re-runs the same publish ONCE with `-p:IlcSingleThreaded=true` (`--parallelism:1`). Any other failure, or a second crash, fails the build. Nothing is muted.
* `AotSafetyRuleTests` pins all of the above: no IL code in `NoWarn` or `WarningsNotAsErrors`, no `TrimmerSingleWarn=true`, and the NAudio umbrella, NAudio.Wasapi and Vortice packages never return.
