## 1. Why This Domain Exists  {#UNDO-WHY}
Undo lived in exactly one window. The Granular Speed Editor's `PushUndo` was genuinely well built —
gesture coalescing, de-duplication, a ceiling enforced on push, redo invalidation. The Crop Tool,
Music Wizard, meme placement, the Video Merger and the main window had **nothing**.

And even in the editor, the forty states were discarded when the window was accepted or closed
(`04_UI_UX_AVALONIA_SPEC.md` §6 UI-GRANULAR). Noticing a mistake five seconds too late made it
permanent.

`UndoStack<T>` generalises that editor's behaviour to `ProjectDocument` so every screen inherits one
history instead of each growing its own half-version.

---

## 2. The Four Rules Are Inherited, Not Invented  {#UNDO-RULES}
These come from the editor's `PushUndo`. They were paid for in bug reports. Do not "simplify" them.

* **U1 — COALESCE A GESTURE.** A drag raises hundreds of changes. Pushes sharing a `gestureKey`
  within `GestureIdleMs = 900` collapse into the ONE state from before the gesture began, so a single
  Ctrl+Z undoes the whole drag.
  ⚠ The idle clock is refreshed **even when the push is dropped**, so the window tracks the LAST
  movement and a slow drag never splits in two. `EndGesture()` on pointer-release is what keeps two
  successive drags of the same handle separately undoable.
  ⚠ **`UNDO_26` — the window is PER INSTANCE.** `new UndoStack<T>(initial, maxDepth, gestureIdleMs)`;
  the default stays `GestureIdleMs = 900` for every existing caller. The Granular editor passes its own
  long-standing 700ms so the migration did not change how a drag feels; no editor's tuning is global.
  `TouchGesture(key)` refreshes the clock of the gesture ALREADY OPEN under that key when a push turned
  out to be a no-op (U4 returns before the bookkeeping) — it can extend a gesture, never open one.
* **U2 — CEILING ON PUSH.** `MaxDepth = 40` (the editor's `MaxUndoDepth`) is applied as the entry
  goes on, never afterwards. Trimming later leaves a window where a large snapshot is alive for
  nothing.
* **U3 — A NEW EDIT BURNS THE REDO BRANCH.** Editing after undoing makes every redo state
  unreachable. Keeping them offers a "redo" that would silently discard the edit just made.
* **U4 — NEVER PUSH A NO-OP.** Equal states mean nothing happened. Growing the stack anyway produces
  the worst undo bug there is: a Ctrl+Z that visibly does nothing, which users read as undo being
  broken and then stop trusting.
  ⚠ Checked BEFORE gesture bookkeeping, so a no-op cannot open a gesture window and swallow the
  user's next real edit.
* **`UNDO_20` — one entry point records an edit.** `MainWindow.PushProjectEdit(label, gestureKey)` → `ProjectSession.PushEdit`
  records the state AFTER the edit with the label the user reads in the undo notice; every Main App
  edit goes through it (the Video Merger's equivalent is `MERGEUNDO_01`, `docs/06` item 5).

---

## 3. State Contract & Threading  {#UNDO-STATE}
* ⚠ **`T` MUST BE IMMUTABLE WITH VALUE EQUALITY.** The stack holds a list of states; mutable ones
  make every entry the same object and undo restores the present — the exact defect this prevents.
  A `record` of value types and immutable collections qualifies; `ProjectDocument` is built for it.
  UI controls, bitmaps, streams and IPC handles are forbidden (UI-GRANULAR's rule, generalised).
  U4 depends on `Equals` being a real state comparison — a reference-equality default silently
  disables it.
* ⚠ **LABELS NAME THE ACTION, NOT THE STATE.** "delete segment" means Ctrl+Z brings the segment
  back. Easy to get backwards; the result is an undo menu naming the wrong operation. The label is
  shown to the user — "Undo move zoom box", never a bare "Undo", because a user who cannot see what
  they are about to lose will not press the button.
* ⚠ **RE-ENTRANCY IS GUARDED.** Restoring a state must not record history. In a real UI, undo
  updates controls whose change events call `Apply`; without the `_restoring` guard the history
  grows on every Ctrl+Z and undo can never reach the beginning.
* ⚠ **NOT THREAD-SAFE, BY DESIGN.** History is UI-thread state. Locking it would invite the
  dispatcher-blocking North Star #6 forbids. Dispatcher only.
* **`Reset` is for loading a different project, not for ordinary edits.** A "cheap" reset to avoid a
  snapshot is how a user loses the ability to undo the step that mattered.

---

## 4. Persistence  {#UNDO-PERSIST}
`UndoEntries` / `RedoEntries` expose the history oldest-first, and `Restore` rebuilds it — this is
what lets undo survive a window close, a screen switch and an app restart, which §1 names as the
defect to fix. `Restore` trims from the OLDEST end, matching U2.

⚠ **HISTORY DOES NOT BELONG INSIDE THE `.fvsproj`.** It is per-machine, disposable, and would bloat
a file that is meant to be portable and shareable — sending a colleague a montage should not send
them forty snapshots of how it was made. It belongs in a sidecar keyed to the project.

**AUTOSAVEBG_01 — sidecar writes from autosave are off the UI thread.** Autosave copies
`UndoEntries` / `RedoEntries` to arrays on the UI thread (entries are immutable, so the copy is a
snapshot) and serialises them via the `UndoSidecarStore.Save(path, fingerprint, undo, redo)`
overload on the thread pool — never the live `UndoStack`. The fingerprint is still taken from
`history.Current`, matching the explicit-save path and the check `OpenAsync` performs.

---

## 5. Open Work Bound To This Spec  {#UNDO-TODO}
`UndoStack<T>` exists and is unit-tested (`tests/FreeVideoStudio.Core.Tests/UndoStackTests.cs`,
covering U1–U4, re-entrancy, reset and restore).

**Closed since this list was written:**

1. **`UNDO_23` — the re-entrancy guard did not cover the notification, which is the only part that
   mattered.** `_restoring` was reset in a `finally` that ran BEFORE `Changed` was raised. `Changed`
   is the handler that repopulates the controls, and a control raising its own change event calls
   `Apply` straight back in — so every Ctrl+Z recorded the echo as a fresh edit and undo could never
   reach the beginning. The guard now spans the invoke, in `Undo`, `Redo`, `Reset` and `Restore`.
   ⚠️ `UndoStackTests.RestoringDoesNotRecordHistory` was RED and had been for long enough that
   nobody looked — see `08` §3 and `CITEST_01` for why.
2. **`UNDO_24` — the sidecar from §4 exists** (`UndoSidecarStore`), keyed by a hash of the
   project's full path, fingerprinted against the document it describes, capped at `MaxEntries` on
   write as well as on restore, and wired to project open and save. A history that belongs to a
   different version of the project is discarded rather than replayed: replaying it walks the user
   into a document that never existed on this timeline, silently.
3. **`UNDO_25` — the Granular editor's history now survives closing the window.** `OnClosed` called
   `ClearUndoHistory("editor closed")`, reasoning that "nothing survives the window that owned
   them". That is true of native handles and false of the user's work: snapshots are plain data
   (U1). Ten minutes of speed ramps died whenever someone closed the editor to glance at the main
   timeline. The history is now parked, keyed by clip path — restoring it into a DIFFERENT clip
   would apply segment boundaries measured against another video's duration.
4. ~~Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y in the main window~~ — done (`PROJSESSION_04`).
5. **`MEMEMODE_01` — every meme property change is undoable.** Mode, corner, size and sound are fields of the
   `MemePlacement` / `EdlMeme` records, so the Speed Editor snapshot, `ProjectDocument` and `MergeEdl` equality
   all see them (U4 stays real). The editor pushes `"change meme"` once per popup confirmation, after which the
   Main App records the returned memes with `PushProjectEdit` and the Merger with `RecordHistory`
   (`MemePresentationModeTests.EveryPropertyChange_IsAnUndoableStep`).

6. **`UNDO_26` — the Granular editor is on `UndoStack<T>`** (over `GranularEditorSnapshot`, not
   `ProjectDocument`: the editor's state carries the freeze and the selection, which `ProjectDocument`
   does not model). One implementation remains. See §7.
7. **`UNDO_27` — the Crop Tool is on `UndoStack<CropLayoutSnapshot>`.** See §7.
8. **`UNDO_28` — the Music wizard has undo/redo**, on `UndoStack<MusicWizardSnapshot>`. See §7.

**Still not done:**

1. Undo/Redo menu labels driven by `NextUndoLabel` / `NextRedoLabel` in the main window. The
   Granular editor, the Crop Tool (button tooltips) and the Music wizard (the undo notice) already
   do this.

---

## 6. Edit-State Equality & Gesture Keys (UNDOEQ_01 / UNDOEQ_02)  {#UNDO-EQUALITY}
* **UNDOEQ_01:** `ProjectDocument` overrides `Equals`/`GetHashCode`. Lists are compared element-wise, the mask by `ProfileName`+`Fingerprint`, and `Merge` element-wise. `CreatedUtc`, `ModifiedUtc`, `Title` and `UnknownFields` are excluded. The compiler default compared the per-capture arrays BY REFERENCE and included `UtcNow` stamps, so U4 never fired in production.
* **UNDOEQ_02:** `SaveRecoveryState(label:, gestureKey:)`. Continuous controls pass a key (`speed-dial`, `quality-dial`, `music-nudge`) and call `EndProjectGesture()` on `ValueChangeCompleted`. Every call site names its action.
* Tests: `ProjectDocumentTests.UndoEq_*`.

---

## 7. Mission 8 — Every Editor On The Shared Stack (UNDO_26 / UNDO_27 / UNDO_28)  {#UNDO-MIGRATION}
There is ONE history engine: `UndoStack<T>`. No window owns a private stack, coalescer or ceiling.
Every snapshot type lives in **Core** (`src/FreeVideoStudio.Core/Undo/`), which does not reference
Avalonia — so a snapshot *cannot* hold a `Control`, `Canvas`, `Bitmap`, `PointerEventArgs`, native
handle, network request, AI `Task` or preview/cache resource. `SharedHistoryMigrationTests` checks the
types by reflection as well.

| Editor | State `T` | Labels | Gestures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Granular | `GranularEditorSnapshot` (segments, cuts, memes, base speed, freeze; selection carried, NOT compared) | the call sites' own (`add segment`, `change speed`, `move meme`, `delete parts`…) | every existing coalesce key; **700ms** window; `EndUndoGesture` on release |
| Crop Tool | `CropLayoutSnapshot` (committed crops + layout; `DisplayName` carried, not compared) | `CropHistoryLabels`: `move crop`, `resize HUD`, `add HUD element`, `delete HUD element`, `change layer order` | a pointer drag/resize is recorded ONCE, on release, only if it changed something |
| Music wizard | `MusicWizardSnapshot` (song, auto-fill queue in order, song start, video/music balance, ducking, smooth blend, loop) | `MusicWizardSnapshot.DescribeChange` (`choose song`, `move song start`, `change music balance`…) | fader sweeps, wheel spins, scrubs and keyboard nudges coalesce (900ms default); pointer release ends them |

* **Granular call convention (UNDO_26).** The editor's ~40 call sites record the state BEFORE a change
  (`PushUndo` at the top of a handler); `UndoStack.Apply` takes the state AFTER. `GranularEditHistory`
  translates once instead of rewriting forty handlers: `Checkpoint(before)` leaves the action PENDING and
  it is committed (`Apply(after, label, key)`) at the next sighting of the live state — the next
  checkpoint, a pointer release, an undo, a redo or parking. U4 became exact: an action that changed
  nothing records nothing (the old stack stored its before-state anyway → a Ctrl+Z that did nothing).
* **Magic Wand (UNDO_27).** Scanning, AI/local candidate publication and browsing candidates are NOT
  history — none of it is in `CropLayoutSnapshot`, and `CropToolWindow.MagicWand.cs` never touches
  `_history`. Committing a candidate (`AddCurrentSelection`) is exactly one step.
* **Shortcuts (UNDO_28).** `HistoryShortcut.Classify`: Ctrl+Z undo; Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z (and
  Ctrl+Shift+Y) redo. A focused text input (`KeyboardFocusPolicy.IsTextInputFocused`) returns `None`
  and the key is NOT handled, so the text box keeps its own undo. The Granular editor's own handler
  (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y, always handled) is unchanged.
* **Restore never records itself.** `UndoStack`'s re-entrancy guard plus each owner's own flag
  (`GranularEditSession.BeginRestore` / `CropEditSession.IsRestoring` — EDITSTATE_01 — and the Music
  wizard's `_restoringHistory`); after re-reading, `ReplaceCurrent` (never `Apply`) so normalisation
  cannot burn the redo branch. The Crop Tool's window rebuild runs INSIDE the guard
  (`CropEditSession.Step(undo, rebuild)`), before the re-read.

### 7.1 Granular APPLY / Reopen Policy  {#UNDO-GRANULAR-APPLY}
* ⚠ **THE APPLY BOUNDARY IS KEPT.** `ClearUndoHistory("changes applied")` still runs on ACCEPT. History
  could survive APPLY only if every snapshot were provably the exact accepted revision the Main App now
  holds — and the Main App rewrites what it receives (cut normalisation, trim offsets, meme re-timing),
  so that cannot be proven. Correctness beats deeper undo history; the Main App's own history
  (`PROJSESSION`) records the APPLY as one step.
* **UNDO_25 park/reopen is kept, and tightened.** A parked history (`ParkedGranularHistory`) records the
  clip key, the state its session OPENED on (`Baseline`) and the state it closed on (`Final`). It is
  replayed only when the reopening editor is for the same clip AND opens on exactly `Baseline` or
  `Final` (`GranularEditHistory.BelongsTo`). A different clip, a different project using the same
  file, or any APPLY / main-window edit since, opens on another state: the history is discarded, never
  replayed. Merge mode (`edl://`) has no clip identity and never parks.

## 8. EDITSTATE_01 — Who Owns The State The History Snapshots  {#UNDO-EDITSTATE}
The history was already shared (§7); the STATE it snapshots still lived in window fields beside
canvases and timers. It now lives in Core, in types that cannot reference Avalonia:

| Editor | State owner | History it owns | The window keeps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Granular | `Core/Editing/GranularEditSession` (segments, cuts, memes in both presentation modes, base speed, freeze, zoom on each segment, selection, MARK START/END, dirty, results, recovery values via `GranularRecoveryCodec`) | `GranularEditHistory` (UNDO_26), the parking slot (`GranularHistoryParking`, UNDO_25) | canvases, drags, pointer capture, timers, mpv, filmstrip, timeline CACHES, the AI tracking preview |
| Crop Tool | `Core/Editing/CropEditSession` (layers = `CropLayer`, layer order, selection by role KEY, tombstones, active profile + name rules, element catalogue, capture resolution, dirty; config values via `CropProfileCodec`) | `UndoStack<CropLayoutSnapshot>` (UNDO_27) | element visuals, adorners, handles, hit testing, frozen-frame zoom, the Magic Wand's scan/AI request/candidates |

* **Calling convention is unchanged.** Window gesture handlers still `PushUndo` / `PushHistory` with
  their own labels and coalesce keys; session COMMANDS (`AddPendingSegment`, `DeleteRange`,
  `AddMeme`, `MoveMemeTo`, `AddLayer`…) checkpoint themselves. Granular checkpoints of either origin
  raise `GranularEditSession.Checkpointed`, which is where the window refreshes its buttons and arms
  RECOVERY_03 — exactly where the old `PushUndo` did.
* **Snapshots stay the §7 types.** `CropLayer.ToState()` projects the mutable layer onto the immutable
  `CropItemState`; no second snapshot model exists.
* **Crop selection is identity.** `SelectedRoleKey` survives a restore that rebuilds every layer object
  when that element still exists; the window still clears it after Undo/Redo, as it always did.
* Tests: `GranularEditSessionTests`, `CropEditSessionTests` (Core), `EditStateExtractionTests` (App).
