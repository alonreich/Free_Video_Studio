# SPECIFICATION GOVERNANCE: ZERO-LEAKAGE CONTRACT

## Code Mini-Map: Bound Source Files & Governance Symbols
| Source File Path | Key Classes, Records & Controls | Core Bound Methods, Properties & Symbols | Subsystem Domain Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/SPEC_GOVERNANCE.md` | Governance Protocol | `Zero-Leakage`, `Proof-of-Read`, `In-Code Sentinel` | Master Governance Contract |
| `docs/README.md` | Master Architectural Router | `9 North Star Invariants`, `Domain Routing` | Architectural Entry Point |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | Flat Symbol & File Lookup | `Symbol -> Spec Section`, `Stable {#ANCHOR} ids`, `CO-GOVERNED marks` | Zero-Cost Routing Lookup |
| `src/FreeVideoStudio.Core/Infrastructure/ApplicationPaths.cs` | `ApplicationPaths` | `ProgramDataRoot`, `RecoveryStateFile`, `SessionStateFile`, `AppDirectoryName` | System Path Governance |
| `src/FreeVideoStudio.Core/Infrastructure/RecoveryManager.cs` | `RecoveryManager` | `SaveState`, `LoadState`, `CheckFault`, `IsSafeModeActive` | Session State & Fault Governance |
| `src/FreeVideoStudio.App/MainWindow.axaml.cs` | `MainWindow` (partial class) | `AttachPreviewMonitor`, `OnSuccessAction` (this file); the recovery hooks live in partials governed by their own headers — `SaveRecoveryState` in `MainWindow.Recovery.cs`, the startup `RecoveryManager.CheckFault()` call in `MainWindow.Wireup.cs` | Main Process Governance Root |

## 0. Routing (do this first, it is nearly free)
Do NOT read every spec. Route once, read one.
* Know the FILE -> `docs/README.md` §3.
* Know only a SYMBOL, CONSTANT or ENGINEERING TAG -> grep `docs/INDEX.md`.
* Landed on a row marked `⚠` -> that file is CO-GOVERNED; read every spec the row names.

## 0a. CRITICAL AGENT MANDATE: STRICT BAN ON `Build.cmd` (CLOUD PUBLISH)
**ALL AUTONOMOUS AI AGENTS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FROM EVER RUNNING `.\Build.cmd` OR `Build.cmd`.**

* **`.\Build.cmd` Officially Publishes to Git Cloud:**
  Running `.\Build.cmd` executes `FvsBuild` in production release mode, which creates release tags and **OFFICIALLY PUBLISHES A NEW PUBLIC VERSION ON GITHUB CLOUD**, making it instantly live and downloadable to everyone worldwide.
* **MANDATORY LOCAL BUILD SCRIPT: `.\dev_build.cmd`:**
  If an AI agent needs to perform a full build test, NativeAOT compilation verification, or packaging test, it **MUST ONLY USE `.\dev_build.cmd`** (or `dotnet build` / `dotnet test`).
  `.\dev_build.cmd` passes `--dev` to `FvsBuild`:
  - Builds strictly locally.
  - Zero git tags created.
  - Zero GitHub releases created or updated.
  - Zero cloud network publishing.
* **Prohibition Severity:** Any automated or agent execution of `.\Build.cmd` is classified as a severe operational violation.

## 1. Absolute Stop-and-Read Mandate
Developers and autonomous AI agents are strictly forbidden from inspecting, generating, refactoring, or modifying code in any source file (`.cs`, `.axaml`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`) without first loading, reading, and citing its mapped specification file from `docs/`. Speculative code modifications without active specification verification are classified as critical system defects.

## 2. Mid-Session Context Boundary Rule
If a debugging session or feature implementation crosses from its initial domain into another (e.g., an FFmpeg export task requiring adjustments to `OutputTimeline.cs`, audio mastering filters, Avalonia UI styles, or disk recovery serialization), EXECUTION MUST HALT IMMEDIATELY.
* Conversational memory, assumed defaults, or heuristic extrapolations are strictly prohibited.
* **CO-GOVERNED FILES:** A source file listed in the Code Mini-Map of MORE THAN ONE spec (marked `⚠ CO-GOVERNED BY` on its row, and `⚠` in `docs/INDEX.md`) is bound by ALL of them simultaneously. Reading one of them is NOT compliance. The authoritative list of multi-domain files is every `⚠` row in `docs/INDEX.md` §1 (kept in step with the spec mini-maps) — there are dozens. Examples only, not the list: `MainWindow.axaml.cs`, `GranularSpeedEditorWindow.axaml.cs`, `MergeEdl.cs`, `ProjectSession.cs`.
* The agent must load and parse the governing `docs/0X_*.md` file before inspecting or touching logic in that secondary domain.
* Cross-domain modifications executed without verifying the target domain's governing specification will be rejected and reverted.

## 3. Mandatory Proof-of-Read Protocol
Every code edit proposal, refactor plan, or architectural implementation block submitted by an AI agent must begin with the following three-line verification header:
```text
[SPEC VERIFIED]: docs/0X_<DOMAIN_SPEC_NAME>.md#<STABLE-ANCHOR>   (anchor, e.g. FFM-BINPATH — never a bare section number)
[INVARIANT QUOTED]: <Exact formula, mathematical constraint, threshold, or boundary rule quoted from that spec>
[SCOPE CLAMP]: <Explicit confirmation of the precise method, struct, or file altered with zero outside side-effects>
```

## 4. In-Code Source Sentinel
Every production C# and AXAML code-behind source file across `src/` must carry the following immutable contract block at Line 1:
```csharp
// [SPEC CONTRACT] STRICT GOVERNANCE:
// Forbidden to modify without reading: docs/0X_<MAPPED_SPEC>.md
// Invariants, constants, and threading models must match spec bit-for-bit.
```

## 5. Specification Invariant Audit Verification
When audits or tests reveal discrepancies between text documentation and active C# implementation:
1. Ground truth resides in mathematical laws, thread safety boundaries, and hardware protection safeguards.
2. Obsolete workflows (e.g., legacy checkmark-based zoom models) must be purged from documentation and replaced with live production invariants (e.g., ZOOMLIVE continuous gestures).
3. Critical unwritten defenses present in source code (e.g., WASAPI 3-second preview clock aborts, render thread OpenGL deadlock mitigations, sub-pixel pointer capture releases, atomic file replacement safeguards) must be codified directly into the governing specifications.

## 6. Mandatory End-User Changelog & Project Structure Staging (CHANGELOG_01)
Every autonomous AI agent modifying application source code, UI elements, workflows, or architectural structure must stage end-user release notes before concluding:
1. **Target:** The top release block in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (`## vYYYY.MM.DD.xxxx (Upcoming)`).
2. **Audience & Style:** Plain, short, oversimplified English for the end user. Technical jargon, internal method names, and class names are strictly forbidden. Describe the user-visible capability or bug fix directly.
3. **5-Release Retention:** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` strictly retains the 5 latest releases. When adding a new release header, the oldest is pruned.
4. **Automated Release Pipeline Integration:** When an official release is published via `Build.cmd` / `FvsBuild`, `GitHubReleasePublisher.GetReleaseNotesFromChangelog` automatically extracts the top notes for GitHub Releases and the in-app update card (`UpdateToastWindow`).
5. **Project Structure Sync:** If new files, classes, or architecture rules are introduced, `project_structure.txt` and `docs/INDEX.md` must be updated in tandem.
6. **Mandatory Completion Block:** An AI agent is strictly forbidden from finishing a task or committing code without completing this changelog staging step.
