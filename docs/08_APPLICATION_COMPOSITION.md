## 1. The Composition Root  {#COMP-ROOT}

* **`COMPOSITION_01` — the graph is built once, in `Program.RunUiAsync`, and nowhere else.**
  Position is load-bearing and is not a style choice:
  * **After** `BootstrapAsync`, because that is what calls `ApplicationPaths.EnsureWritableDirectories()`. A graph built earlier hands every service paths to directories that do not exist.
  * **Before** `AppBuilder.StartWithClassicDesktopLifetime`, so the first window constructed already finds a complete graph.
  `AppServices.Current` **throws** rather than lazily half-building one. A half-built graph is how a fault sink ends up null at exactly the moment something faults.

* **No DI container. This is deliberate and it is not preference.**
  1. **Mandate #1** — single binary, NativeAOT, `TrimMode=full`. A container resolves by `Type` at run time; every resolution is a trim-analyser liability, and `AOTSAFETY_01` states that warnings here are fixed, never muted.
  2. **A container hides the graph.** The root is ~30 lines and can be read in full. "What does this window actually depend on" should be answerable by reading a file, not by executing a registration list.

* **`COMPOSITION_02` — `AppServices.Current` is a migration shim with a deletion date.**
  A static accessor is a service locator — the exact anti-pattern the root exists to retire. It is tolerated only because ~25,000 lines of window code-behind are constructed by Avalonia's lifetime and by XAML, neither of which can pass constructor arguments.
  * **New code** takes dependencies as **constructor parameters**. It must never read `Current`.
  * **Legacy window code-behind** may read `Current` until its view-model is extracted.
  * `Current` is **deleted** at the end of the view-model extraction phase.
  * `ArchitectureRuleTests.ServiceLocatorUsageDoesNotIncrease` holds the line: the count may fall, never rise. Raise the baseline **only** when wiring an existing legacy window, and lower it whenever one is migrated.

* **The seams, and why each exists.** A seam is added when it removes a reason a view-model cannot be constructed in a test — not for symmetry.

  | Seam | Interface | Substitutes |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `INJSEAM_01` | `IProjectStore` | the real filesystem, so "what does the UI do when the save fails" is testable |
  | `INJSEAM_02` | `IClock` | wall time, so the 24h update throttle and the 14-day log trim are testable without sleeping |
  | `INJSEAM_03` | `IUserNotifier` / `IActiveWindowProvider` | a live Avalonia `Window`, so a view-model needs no dispatcher |
  | `INJSEAM_04` | `IFilePickerService` | native OS dialogs, so Save/Open Project can be regression-tested |

  ⚠️ `FileProjectStore` is a **forward**, not a second implementation. The atomic-write protocol, the `.bak` cascade and the amputation rule stay in `ProjectStore`/`ProjectSerializer` under spec 06. `05_SYSTEM_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md` §4c is explicit: *never reimplement this sequence at a call site*.

---

## 2. Fault Tiers — Silence Is Not An Option  {#COMP-FAULTS}

* **`FAULTTIER_01` — the measured problem.** The audit that opened this work (2026-09-20, against `main` at `919f52b`) counted **917 lines containing `catch` across ~90,000 lines of `src/`** — one per 98 — of which **368** were bare `catch (Exception)`, **391** sites carried a "best-effort"/"ignore" comment, and **87** had a literally empty body, **59 of those with no comment at all**. The dominant shape was `catch (Exception ex) { RuntimeLog.Fail("AREA", ex); }`: a log line the user will never open, followed by the program continuing as though nothing happened.

  ⚠️ Those are the BASELINE figures and they are deliberately not restated as current. The living numbers are the test baselines in §3, which are the ones a change is measured against; this paragraph records what the problem looked like when it was found.

  A failed thumbnail, a failed ffprobe and a failed settings write all presented identically to the person using the app — **as nothing happening**. The user is left to guess whether they mis-clicked.

* **Every catch answers one question:** *what does the person in front of this window need to know?* There are exactly three answers, and no fourth door:

  | Tier | Bar for using it | What the user sees |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `Recoverable` | the user's **outcome is unchanged** — a retry worked, a documented default took over | nothing; DEBUG log only |
  | `Degraded` | something perceptible stopped; the session is intact | a `FloatingNotice` naming **what stopped AND what still works** |
  | `Fatal` | the thing they asked for cannot happen, or their work is at risk | a modal dialog with the message and the log path |

  ⚠️ The bar for `Recoverable` is "the outcome is unchanged", **not** "we kept running". If the feature the user asked for did not happen, it is `Degraded`, however gracefully the code coped.

* **`OperationCanceledException` is re-thrown by `GuardAsync`, never reported.** A cancel is the user getting what they asked for. Reporting it as a fault is how a Cancel button ends up showing an error pill.

* **`FAULTSTORM_01` — the reporter needs its own flood control.** Degraded faults are raised from worker threads, and a failing per-frame operation raises one at frame rate. `FloatingNotice` dedupes identical *text* inside 1.4s (F4), but a message embedding a changing value defeats that. The sink gates on `(Tier, Area, UserMessage)` for **8s** (degraded) and **60s** (fatal — a repeat modal is a trap the user cannot click out of). **A suppressed repeat still reaches the log**, so nothing is lost for diagnosis. The gate dictionary is bounded at 256 entries because message text embedding a filename mints a new key every time.

* **`UserFacingFaultSink` must never throw.** A reporter that can fault is a reporter that call sites wrap in `try { } catch { }` — the exact shape being retired. Its outermost guard writes through `RuntimeLog.EmergencyWrite` and returns.

* **Migration is a ratchet, not a sweep.** 59 unexplained empty catches could not be triaged correctly in one change; each needs a human decision about tier. `ArchitectureRuleTests.UnexplainedEmptyCatchBlocksDoNotIncrease` is green at its baseline (now **25**, §3) and can only get stricter. **A permanently red test gets deleted, so no rule here starts red.**

---

### `FAULTTIER_02` — THE SINK HAD TO BE REACHABLE BEFORE ANY OF THIS COULD HAPPEN  {#COMP-FAULTCHANNEL}

⚠️ **The measurement that forced this.** A year of `FAULTTIER_01` produced **three** call sites
reaching `IFaultSink`, out of roughly 900 catch blocks. That is not negligence, it is arithmetic.
Reporting required an `IFaultSink` INSTANCE, and the code that catches exceptions is overwhelmingly
static helpers and window code-behind that Avalonia constructs — neither of which has a constructor
anyone can pass one to. Every conversion therefore needed a plumbing change first, and a 900-site
plumbing change does not happen. The vocabulary was right and the route was missing.

* **`Faults` is an ambient sink, installed once from the composition root.** `Faults.Recoverable` /
  `.Degraded` / `.Fatal` work from anywhere, including a static utility and a thread with no object
  graph in scope.

* **⚠️ WHY THIS IS NOT A BACKDOOR AROUND `COMPOSITION_02`.** That rule retires the service locator
  for **collaborators** — things a class does its work *with*, which a test must substitute to
  exercise that work. A fault sink is not a collaborator, it is a **diagnostic channel**, in the
  same category as `RuntimeLog` and `CoreLogger`, both already static by deliberate decision and on
  nobody's list to inject. New code still takes `IFaultSink` in its constructor; this is for the
  places that cannot.

* **`CoreLogger.Swallowed` / `RuntimeLog.Swallowed` route through it.** Those two had **337** call
  sites between them — far and away the most common way this codebase handled a caught exception,
  and entirely invisible to the fault system. Routing them converted all of them in one edit instead
  of 337. Nothing the user sees changes, because `Recoverable` is log-only by definition. What
  changes is that the failures now EXIST: classified, counted, in the diagnostic bundle, and
  reclassifiable to `Degraded` by a one-line edit at the call site.

  ⚠️ "Swallowed" asserts `Recoverable`, and that is a CLAIM the caller is making. The bar is "the
  user's outcome is unchanged", not "we kept running". The 337 inherited sites are grandfathered
  because that is what they already did; they are not thereby blessed.

* **The sweep, measured.** 276 catch blocks reported *nothing* — no log, no fault, no rethrow, no
  notice. After the sweep: **3**, all of them cancellation or retry guards. Unexplained empty
  catches went 59 → 20. `ArchitectureRuleTests.EveryCatchBlockReportsSomewhere` holds the line, with
  the seven files of the reporting path named individually rather than waved through by a pattern —
  "the logger may not log its own failure" is a real exemption and "I could not think of a message"
  is not, and a rule that cannot tell them apart is a rule that gets widened.

* **`OperationCanceledException` is exempt by type, not by baseline.** `FAULTTIER_01` already says a
  cancel is the user getting what they asked for. A rule that pushed anyone into logging one would
  be actively harmful.

---

## 3. Executable Rules — Tests Instead Of Paragraphs  {#COMP-ARCHTEST}

* **`ARCHTEST_01` — why this exists.** `docs/` holds ~2,000 lines of specification, and most of it is a post-mortem diary: `DOUBLEFIRE_01` ("invisible to reading"), `SLIDER_09` ("invisible in code review"), `QUALITY_04` ("looked missing rather than broken"), `SEEKSTORM_01` (310 seeks in 1.74s). Each was found by a human running the app, sometimes over several diagnosis cycles, then fenced off with a paragraph.

  **A paragraph only works if the next person reads it. A test works whether they do or not.**

* **Entry criterion for a rule here:** a machine can check it and a reviewer reliably cannot. Rules requiring judgement stay in prose.

* **The rules run on source TEXT, deliberately** — every defect they catch is something the compiler is happy with. They strip comments and string literals first (`BlankCommentsAndStrings`), because this codebase documents its rules by quoting the offending pattern; without that, the docs trip the tests that enforce them.

* **Current rules and their standing** (selected rules; current results come from the test runner):

  | Rule | Enforces | Standing |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `ProductionNamespacesUseTheProductRoot` | production namespace declarations use `FreeVideoStudio.*` | **clean — 0** |
  | `NoControlCarriesBothCommandAndClick` | `DOUBLEFIRE_01` (04 §4) | **clean — 0** |
  | `NoRawHexColoursInSharedStyling` | Invariant #5 (04 §1) | **clean — 0** (10 fixed; see §4) |
  | `ZoompanFilterIsNeverEmitted` | Invariant #4 | **clean — 0** |
  | `UnexplainedEmptyCatchBlocksDoNotIncrease` | `FAULTTIER_01` | ratchet, baseline **25** |
  | `EveryCatchBlockReportsSomewhere` | `FAULTTIER_02` | ratchet, baseline **7** (seven reporting-path files exempt by name; injected `IFaultSink` `.Recoverable/.Degraded/.Fatal(` calls count as reporting) |
  | `EveryProductionSourceFileCarriesTheSpecContract` | `SPEC_GOVERNANCE.md` §4 | **clean — 0** (121 fixed; see §4) |
  | `BlockingWaitsOnAsyncCodeDoNotIncrease` | `ASYNCUI_01` | ratchet, baseline **5** |
  | `AsyncVoidMethodsDoNotIncrease` | `ASYNCUI_02` | ratchet, baseline **31** |
  | `ServiceLocatorUsageDoesNotIncrease` | `COMPOSITION_02` | ratchet, baseline **3** |
  | `ImperativeControlLookupsDoNotIncrease` | `MVVM_01` (§3a) | ratchet, baseline **700** (lowered from 973 by `MVVM_03`) |
  | `WindowCodeBehindDoesNotGrow` | `MVVM_02` (§3a) | 8 grandfathered ceilings; **1,000** for new files |
  | `EveryFixSentinelStillResolves` | `SYS-DEVBUILD` / `SYS-VERIFYTOOL` | **clean** — every `build/sentinels.txt` entry |
  | `DevCmdDelegatesTheSentinelCheckRatherThanParsingIt` | `SYS-VERIFYTOOL` / `VERIFYHALT_01` | **clean** — `dev.cmd` runs `build/FvsVerify` and reads its exit code |

* **Sentinel or test?** When a fix earns a `TAG=path` line in `build/sentinels.txt` (checked by `build/FvsVerify`), ask whether it could be a test instead. **A sentinel proves a fix has not been DELETED; a test proves it has not been BROKEN.** Prefer the test. Keep the sentinel when the fix is a configuration value or a comment-documented ordering that no assertion can see.

* **`ASYNCUI_01` / `ASYNCUI_02`.** 5 blocking waits (`.Result` / `.Wait()` / `GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) and 31 `async void` methods, against 106 `Dispatcher.UIThread` call sites. On the UI thread a blocking wait is a deadlock of exactly the shape `SEEKSTORM_01` describes: the UI thread waiting on work that needs the UI thread. An `async void` that throws bypasses every catch in the stack and lands in `AppDomain.UnhandledException` — the process goes down from a background continuation, with nothing on screen. An `async void` that survives review must be an event handler bound directly to an Avalonia event, **and its whole body must sit inside one try/catch reporting through `IFaultSink`**.

---

## 3a. View-Model Extraction  {#COMP-MVVM}

* **`MVVM_01` — the measured problem.** The App layer resolves controls by name **973 times**
  (`FindControl<T>` / `this.Get<T>`) against **69** `{Binding}` expressions and **2** classes
  implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged`. The `ViewModels/` folder exists but is vestigial:
  `MainViewModel` is 434 lines against `MainWindow.axaml.cs`'s 3,420 plus four partials, and
  `GranularSpeedEditorWindow`, `CropToolWindow`, `MusicWizardWindow`, `VoiceOverWindow` and
  `VideoMergerWindow` have **no view-model at all** — between them they hold ~1,270 private fields
  of application state in code-behind.

  This is WinForms written in Avalonia. It is why those five files are 8,062 / 6,496 / 5,715 /
  3,647 / 2,251 lines, and it is the mechanical reason the App layer has no unit tests: there is
  nothing to construct without a live visual tree.

* **It is also a correctness problem, not only a tidiness one.** `QUALITY_04` records a named
  control declared `Text=""` with no writer: the value behind it was computed correctly on every
  edit and went nowhere, so the feature *"looked missing rather than broken, which is the harder
  failure to spot"*. A binding fails loudly. A `FindControl` that nobody writes to fails silently.

* **THE LINE. Not all of it moves.** A conversion is a judgement, and the judgement is:
  * **Moves to a view-model:** anything the user would expect to survive — a value, a selection, a
    mode, a toggle, a list of segments. Anything an export reads. Anything a test would want to
    assert.
  * **Stays in code-behind:** genuine view concerns — canvas geometry, pointer capture, drag
    deltas, hit-testing, render transforms, animation clocks. Forcing those into a view-model buys
    nothing and costs the clarity that `04_UI_UX_AVALONIA_SPEC.md` §6 depends on.

* **`MVVM_02` — the ceilings.** Eight oversized window code-behind files are grandfathered at a
  measured ceiling and may only shrink (`WindowCodeBehindDoesNotGrow` holds the table). A window
  created after this specification is capped at **1,000 lines**, because by the time anyone notices
  a new one has passed four figures, extracting it is the multi-week job the existing ones already
  represent.

* **Both rules are RATCHETS, enforced by `ArchitectureRuleTests`.** Hundreds of call sites (baseline
  **700**) cannot be converted without a compiler in the loop, and a sweep that cannot be built and run is a sweep
  that ships a broken editor. The numbers may only fall; lower the baseline in the same change
  that lowers the count.

* **`EDITSTATE_01` — the first two extractions, and what they did NOT do.** The Granular editor's and
  the Crop Tool's DURABLE edit state moved to `Core/Editing/GranularEditSession` and
  `Core/Editing/CropEditSession` (plus the pure codecs `GranularRecoveryCodec` / `CropProfileCodec`).
  Constructible with no window (`new GranularEditSession(path, trimStart, trimEnd, parking)`,
  `new CropEditSession(isReservedProfileName)`): every dependency is a constructor argument, none reads
  `AppServices.Current`, and Core cannot reference Avalonia. They are state owners with logical
  commands, NOT view-models and not "editor services": canvas geometry, pointer capture, drag deltas,
  hit testing, timers, mpv, bitmaps, the timeline caches and the Magic Wand's transient AI state stay in
  the windows, per THE LINE above. Ceilings lowered to the measured counts:
  `GranularSpeedEditorWindow.axaml.cs` 7537 → 6587, `CropToolWindow.axaml.cs` 6002 → 5403.
  `FindControl` (699) and `AppServices.Current` (3) counts are unchanged — no binding was introduced yet.

* **`COMPOSITION_02` is the finish line.** Each window that gains a real view-model takes its
  collaborators as constructor parameters and stops reading `AppServices.Current`. When the
  service-locator ratchet reaches zero, the shim is deleted.

---

### `CITEST_01` / `SYS-CI` — NONE OF THESE RULES RAN ANYWHERE  {#COMP-CI}

⚠️ **Fifteen ratchets, 201 fix sentinels and ~215 behavioural tests, and nothing executed them
except a developer remembering to.** There was no CI of any kind. A ratchet nobody pulls is a
comment.

The cost was not theoretical. When `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was added the suite was **red on two
platform-independent tests, both genuine shipped product bugs** — `UNDO_23` (undo re-entrancy) and
`PROJ_10` (the project fingerprint reading back as zero). Both had been red long enough that nobody
looked, because five Windows-only tests were *also* permanently red beside them: they FAILED rather
than skipped off Windows, so "the suite is red" was the normal state. `CITEST_01` makes the
inapplicable ones skip, which is what lets a red result mean "something broke".

CI runs the sentinels on Linux first (~40s, fails fast), then builds and tests on `windows-latest`,
then proves the NativeAOT publish links on `main` — AOT failures do not appear in `dotnet build`,
only at publish, in the linker.

---

## 4. Findings Closed By This Specification  {#COMP-FINDINGS}

* **`SPEC_GOVERNANCE.md` §4 was unenforced: 121 of the 188 source files then present carried no `[SPEC CONTRACT]` sentinel** — 64% of the codebase was invisible to the routing protocol that governs it. Every file carries it now, mapped to its governing spec via `docs/README.md` §3, with co-governed files naming every binding spec and stating that reading one is not compliance. `EveryProductionSourceFileCarriesTheSpecContract` keeps it that way, so the count is enforced rather than recorded.

* **`VERIFYHALT_01` — `VERIFY_PATCHES` was a no-op.** The subroutine built its `MISSING` list correctly and then returned. `MISSING` was **assigned in two places and read in none**, so all 133 fix sentinels were checked and the answer discarded. The mechanism `05` §4a calls "halts loudly if one is absent" could not halt, and could not be loud.
  Two defects, both closed: the unread variable, and `exit /b 1` inside a `call`ed subroutine returning from the *subroutine* rather than the script — so the call site now tests `if errorlevel 1`.
  ⚠️ `VERIFYLOOP_01` had already learned this exact lesson once, about two silently skipped entries, and its fix left the reporting half unwritten. **A guard that cannot fail is worse than no guard**, because it is trusted.

* **`STRIPCOST_01` was stale and nothing could say so.** Its tag no longer existed in `GranularSpeedEditorWindow.axaml.cs`. Not a revert: commit `ad0b7bd` deleted the per-slot `Image` path entirely and replaced it with `Controls/TimelineFilmstrip`, which draws through `DrawingContext.DrawImage` with explicit source and destination rects — no layout box to oversize, no 32768px bitmap for Skia to rasterise. The defect is structurally unreachable, so the sentinel is **retired** with a note, following the `WIZPROGRESS_01` precedent.

* **Invariant #5 had 10 live violations**, all raw hex in shared styling:
  * Six scrims (`#E6000000` ×4, `#F0000000`, `#90000000`) across five windows, each window keeping its own copy of "dim what is behind this" with nothing enforcing that the four identical ones stayed identical. Now `AppScrimSoftBrush` / `AppScrimBrush` / `AppScrimStrongBrush`, deliberately **theme-invariant** like the existing `AppOverlayBrush`: a scrim's job is to push content away from the eye, and on a light ground a light scrim does not do that. Pick by intent — *soft* (flyout open, context still legible), *base* (blocking operation owns the window), *strong* (a rebuild is discarding what is behind it).
  * Four `ZOOMCARD_01` states in the Granular editor's "How should the zoom arrive?" dialog (`#222234` rest, `#181824` bullet well, `#2f2f45` hover, `#3a2b48` checked) — **dark-theme values in a suite that ships a Light variant**, so in Light mode the dialog rendered as a block of near-black cards. Invisible to anyone who never switched theme. Now `AppZoomCard*Brush`, defined in both `ThemeDictionaries`. The Light `checked` state is a desaturated tint because the card border already carries the full accent, and two saturated accents stacked read as a rendering fault rather than a selection.

* **`SIGNMANDATE_01` / `UPDATETRUST_02` — the signing gap.** See `05_SYSTEM_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md` §5 (SYS-SIGNING), amended by this change.

---

### `LOGVIS_01` — RECOVERABLE MEANS "NO NOTICE", NOT "NO LOG"  {#COMP-LOGVIS}
* The `Recoverable` tier was `RuntimeLog.Debug`, which is a no-op unless `FVS_DEV_LOG_DIR` is set, so ~560 `Swallowed()` sites wrote NOTHING in shipped builds. Now each call site writes one `[RECOVERABLE]` INFO line per 30 s (with a held-back count) in every build. The stack trace stays dev-only. The user still sees nothing, which is the definition of the tier.
* `CoreLogger.Warn` / `RuntimeLog.WarnThrottled`: handled FAILURE lines (e.g. "disk flush error", "StopRecording threw") are production-visible and throttled. `Debug` is for traces and full exception dumps only.
* `FaultCounters` counts every fault by tier/area, and `DiagnosticBundle` prints it under `FAULTS`.
* ⚠ This supersedes "DEBUG log only" in the tier table (§2): Recoverable = no UI + throttled INFO breadcrumb.
