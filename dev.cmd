REM
REM Same as the default watch mode, except the log is written INSIDE the repo

REM project tree exists so a normal run cannot litter it and so a log can never
REM be committed; this mode is opt-in, announces itself, and .devlogs\ is
REM gitignored, so neither risk applies. It exists because a log nobody can
REM reach is a log nobody can read when a fault needs diagnosing off-machine.

REM Subroutine: VERIFY_PATCHES - SYS-VERIFYTOOL.
REM
REM THIS SUBROUTINE NO LONGER PARSES ANYTHING. The sentinel list lives in
REM build\sentinels.txt and the checker is build\FvsVerify, a C# console
REM app with its own tests in tests\FvsVerify.Tests. dev.cmd's entire job
REM is to run it and read the exit code.
REM
REM WHY IT MOVED: as a batch FOR list this check broke three times and
REM every failure was silent.
REM   VERIFYLOOP_01  - the old per-tag `call :<label>` subroutine seeked labels by BYTE OFFSET
REM                    through a mixed-EOL file; two seeks landed badly, so
REM                    2 of 49 sentinels were skipped and the run said OK.
REM   LISTCOMMENT_01 - REM is not a comment inside a FOR list. Each
REM                    annotation became six or seven bogus sentinels.
REM   BATCHPARENS_01 - one round bracket in an annotation, even inside a
REM                    REM, closed the list early and ran the next word.
REM   VERIFYHALT_01  - the MISSING variable was assigned and never read, so
REM                    for its whole existence this check could not fail.
REM
REM None of those are bugs in the sentinel idea. They are what a list of
REM 164 strings, a comment syntax and a file search cost in a language with
REM no list type, no comments inside a list, no escaping - and, decisively,
REM no way to write a test against the result. Invariant #8 says every rule
REM that can be a test is a test; this one now is, twice over.
REM
REM To add a sentinel: add one TAG=path line to build\sentinels.txt.
REM Nothing in this file changes, ever again.

REM
REM Name-based taskkill only catches what we can name. The PowerShell pass
REM below is the real guard: it kills ANY process whose executable lives
REM under this repository, which covers the app, its companion windows
REM (Merger, Crop Tools), and every backend/frontend child it spawns
REM (mpv.exe, ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe) no matter how it was orphaned.
REM An orphaned mpv keeps a libmpv IPC pipe and a D3D device alive; an
REM orphaned app keeps a file lock on bin\, which is what makes the next
REM build silently reuse a stale binary.
