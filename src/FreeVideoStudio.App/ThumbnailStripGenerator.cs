/// LANES_01 — builds the "film strip" image that fills a 60px timeline lane.
///
/// Renders N evenly-spaced frames of a video range into ONE tiled PNG (`tile=Nx1`), 60px tall, so
/// the caller can stretch a single Image across the lane instead of managing N separate bitmaps.
///
/// ── WHY IT LIVES HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// This logic was written for Music Wizard phase 3 and lived as a private method on that window.
/// The Granular Speed Editor now needs the identical strip, and copying it would have created a
/// second implementation free to drift — different frame counts, different scaling, a different
/// temp-file cleanup story. `MusicWizardWindow.GenerateThumbnailsStripAsync` now delegates here,
/// so there is exactly one.
///
/// ── CALLER OWNS THE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// On success this returns a path to a temp PNG the caller MUST delete when it is done (both
/// callers track theirs in a list and delete on teardown). It is not cached and never reused
/// between runs — see mandate #1.
///
/// ── THROTTLE_01 — EVERY PROCESS THIS CLASS SPAWNS IS BELOW-NORMAL AND YIELDS ──────────────
/// A film strip is a 60px UI decoration; it must never compete with the preview monitor for
/// CPU or disk. Two mechanisms, both scoped to this file because this file owns every
/// extraction process:
///   * OS-level: every FFmpeg here is started at ProcessPriorityClass.BelowNormal, so the
///     scheduler only gives it cores the Normal-priority player is not using.
///   * Cooperative: <see cref="StreamAsync"/> accepts a yield gate; while it says "something
///     is playing" the reader stops consuming, FFmpeg blocks on a full pipe, and its decode
///     and disk reads stop — resuming later from the exact byte it stopped at. Only
///     background callers (the prewarm) pass the gate; a lane a user is watching fill never
///     waits on playback.
