///
///   Voice Over Studio      grip drawn, wired.                     works
///   Granular Speed Editor  grip drawn, NEVER WIRED.               a dead decoration — the

/// Two near-identical copies of the same 20 lines had already drifted into "one works, one does
/// not", which is exactly what a shared implementation prevents. Attach() is now the only way a
/// window gets a grip: it reuses the Border the XAML already declares where there is one, builds
/// one where there is not, and wires the behaviour identically in both cases.
///
/// ⚠️ NORTH STAR 1 — the mark is vector geometry built in memory (PathGeometry), never an image
/// asset beside the binary.
/// ⚠️ NORTH STAR 5 — the stroke is bound to the `AppBorderBrush` TOKEN through a resource
/// observable, not resolved once to a literal, so it follows a theme change like everything else.
