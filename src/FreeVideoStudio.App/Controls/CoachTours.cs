/// ISSUE_04 — EVERY SCREEN'S WALKTHROUGH SCRIPT, IN ONE PLACE.
///
/// The engine that draws these is <see cref="CoachOverlay"/>. This file is deliberately nothing but
/// copy, so the wording can be reviewed and improved without touching animation code, and so it is
/// obvious at a glance which screens have onboarding and which do not.
///
/// WRITING RULES — these are what make the difference between a tour and a wall of jargon:
///   (W1) Write for someone who has NEVER edited a video. No "trim", "segment", "render", "encode",
///        "codec", "keyframe". Say "cut", "block", "save your video".
///   (W2) Title: six words or fewer, in the user's language, not the button's label.
///   (W3) Body: two sentences maximum. Say what the thing DOES and why they would want it.
///   (W4) Every TargetName must be a real x:Name in that window's .axaml. A name that no longer
///        exists does not crash — CoachOverlay dims the whole screen and shows the text as plain
///        advice — but it silently loses the pointing, so check names when you rename a control.
///   (W5) Keep tours to 5-7 steps. Past that people stop reading and hit SKIP, which burns their
///        remaining automatic showings for that screen.
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
