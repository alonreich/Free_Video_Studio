/// ISSUE_09 + ISSUE_14 — ONE NOTIFICATION STYLE FOR THE WHOLE SUITE, AND THE GHOST CANVAS IT USES.
///
/// WHAT WAS WRONG (ISSUE_09). Six windows told the user things in five different ways:
///   Main App        a Popup floating up over the video, fading out   (the one people liked)
///   Speed Editor    the same Popup, plus a status line at the bottom
///   Music Wizard    a hand-rolled grey Border sliding in from the top for 2.5s
///   Video Merger    a text line under the queue
///   Crop Tools      a text line at the bottom
///   Voice Over      a status label
/// So "did that work?" had a different answer, in a different place, on every screen — and the
/// Music Wizard's version silently showed NOTHING if its host panel could not be found.
///
/// WHAT THIS IS. The float-up-and-fade notice, extracted from the Main App and made reusable. Any
/// window can raise one with a single call and no XAML.
///
/// WHY IT IS A CANVAS AND NOT THE OLD Popup (ISSUE_14, ghost 1). The old FloatingFeedback needed
/// THREE named XAML controls per window (a Popup, its Border, its TextBlock) and an OS-level popup
/// window, which is exactly why no other screen could reuse it. Meanwhile MainWindow.axaml carried
/// an element called `OverlayCanvas`, commented "for Pop-up Badges and Custom Floating Animations",
/// that NOTHING in the entire source tree ever drew into — a sheet of clear glass built for this
/// job and then never connected. It is connected now: when a window has an `OverlayCanvas` this
/// draws into it, and when it does not, one is created on the fly. The dead element became the
/// engine, and the per-window Popups are gone.
///
/// HARD RULES.
///   (F1) NEVER throws into a caller. A missing notification must not break the action it was
///        reporting on.
///   (F2) The host canvas is ALWAYS IsHitTestVisible=false. These float over live controls,
///        including the timeline; one must never eat a click.
///   (F3) ZIndex sits below CoachOverlay (int.MaxValue) on purpose, so a notice cannot cover the
///        walkthrough that is teaching the user what the notice means.
///   (F4) Identical text inside DedupeWindow is dropped. Several callers fire on drag ticks, and
///        without this a drag would stack forty copies of the same sentence up the screen.
///   (F5) At most MaxConcurrent are alive at once; the oldest is retired early. A burst must
///        degrade to "the last few", never to an unreadable pile.
