/// <c>CropToolWindow</c>'s root <c>Content</c> is a <c>Border</c>, not a <c>Panel</c>. The naive
/// <c>window.Content as Panel</c> returns null there, and the feature silently disables itself
/// across an entire application window — no crash, no log, just a walkthrough or a notice that
/// never appears. That is a bug you only find by using the app. Discovering it twice, in two
/// copies, is exactly the cost this consolidation removes: the next window whose root is some
/// other wrapper needs one fix, not two.
