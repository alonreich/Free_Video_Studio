/// <summary>
/// Makes the timeline scrubber knob react to the user, on every timeline in the suite.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS — the knob could not do it on its own.
/// Every timeline in this app lays the seek Canvas (TimelineMarkersCanvas and friends) in the SAME
/// grid row as the Slider, declared AFTER it, with Background="Transparent" and
/// IsHitTestVisible="True". The canvas therefore covers the slider completely and takes every
/// pointer event. Two consequences that looked like styling bugs but are pure hit-testing:
///
///   * The Thumb never receives :pointerover or :pressed, so `Thumb:pointerover` /
///     `Thumb:pressed` styles can never fire. The knob stayed flat while dragging.
///   * `Slider:pointerover` fires ONLY in the thin band where the 44px slider peeks out beyond the
///     32px canvas. Moving the mouse along the timeline crossed that band repeatedly, so the knob
///     grew and shrank over and over — the reported "stutter".
///
/// The canvas is the thing the user actually touches, so the canvas is what reports the state.
/// This flips two classes on the Slider, which the styles in AvaloniaApp.axaml key off:
///   Slider.knobhover -> the pointer is anywhere over the timeline
///   Slider.knobdrag  -> the pointer is held down on the timeline
///
/// Do not "simplify" these back to Thumb or Slider pseudo-classes — see above for why neither
/// works while the seek canvas is on top.
