/// <summary>
/// MVVM_03 — the cached control accessors for <see cref="PhaseOverlayControl"/>.
///
/// <para>
/// ⚠️ IN ITS OWN FILE ON PURPOSE. MVVM_02 caps window code-behind and the cap may only ever
/// fall, so adding these to the code-behind — even while REMOVING lookups from it — would
/// have pushed several files past their ceiling and forced the ratchet up. A ratchet that
/// gets raised to accommodate an improvement stops being a ratchet.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// These replace repeated <c>this.FindControl&lt;T&gt;("Name")</c> calls — some controls were
/// resolved by string fifteen times in one file. Each lookup walks the visual tree and can
/// return null, so a renamed control compiled cleanly and produced a dead button at run time
/// (QUALITY_04). Now a rename breaks in exactly one place.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// This is a STEP toward MVVM_01, not the destination. The end state is a binding to a
/// view-model property; until then, one resolution per control means the eventual binding
/// replaces one accessor instead of hunting every call site.
/// </para>
