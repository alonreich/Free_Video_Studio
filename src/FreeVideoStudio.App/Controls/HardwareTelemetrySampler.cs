/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// TELEMETRY_01 — samples system CPU load, memory pressure and GPU utilisation for the export
/// overlay's live gauges.
///
/// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN TYPE. It was four fields and five methods inside
/// <see cref="PhaseOverlayControl"/>, a 2,492-line control that also hosts a progress bar, a log
/// tail, a Win32 taskbar integration and a fighting-game easter egg. Measured by identifier
/// reference count in that one file, <c>fight</c> outnumbers <c>Progress</c> six to one. Sampling
/// hardware is a reusable, testable job; welded to an easter egg it is neither, and its state sat
/// in the same 117-field bag as the animation state.
///
/// ⚠️ TWO REAL CONCURRENCY DEFECTS CAME ACROSS WITH IT AND ARE FIXED HERE:
///
///   1. OVERLAPPING SAMPLES CORRUPTED THE CPU READING. The host's 1-second DispatcherTimer fired
///      <c>Task.Run(...)</c> with NO overlap guard, and <c>GetCpuUsage</c> is a read-modify-write
///      of <c>_lastIdle</c>/<c>_lastSys</c> — it derives a percentage from the DELTA since the
///      previous call. Two ticks running concurrently on thread-pool threads both read the old
///      counters, both compute a delta, and both write back; the second delta is then measured
///      against a baseline the first already advanced. The result is a nonsense percentage
///      (clamped to 0, or a spike). The likeliest moment for the pool to be busy enough to delay a
///      tick is during a heavy export — which is exactly when this overlay is on screen and being
///      watched. <see cref="TryBeginSample"/> makes a sample single-flight, and the counters are
///      only ever touched under <c>_cpuGate</c>.
///
///   2. THE GPU READING CROSSED THREADS UNSYNCHRONISED. <c>_lastGpu</c> was written from
///      nvidia-smi's <c>OutputDataReceived</c> callback thread and read on the UI thread as a plain
///      field, so the UI could read an indefinitely stale value with no memory barrier. It is now
///      written and read through <see cref="Volatile"/>.
///
/// Neither defect can corrupt data or crash — they put a wrong number on a gauge. That is
/// precisely why they were never worth their own finding, and precisely why the file kept growing
/// around them.
