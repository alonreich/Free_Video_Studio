/// <summary>
/// DETACH_01 — ONE implementation of "pop the video preview out into its own window", shared by
/// every screen in the suite that shows a live preview.
///
/// The Main App had this behaviour and nothing else did. Rather than copy the reparenting dance
/// into the Granular editor, the Music Wizard, the Voice Over window and the Merger — four more
/// places to get the teardown order wrong — the whole mechanism lives here and each window
/// supplies only two things:
///
///   • a BOUNDS KEY, which is what gives every screen its OWN memory of size, position, maximised
///     state and therefore which physical display it was last opened on. They are deliberately
///     separate keys: detaching the Granular preview onto the second monitor must not drag the
///     Main App's preview there next time.
///   • a CONTENT ACCESSOR returning the control to move. Usually the <see cref="MpvVideoView"/>
///     itself, but the Granular editor hands over its whole Viewbox so the zoom overlay and the
///     phone frame travel WITH the picture and stay in register with it.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ORIGIN IS CAPTURED, NOT ASSUMED. The Main App's original version hard-coded
/// "put it back into MainVideoGrid at index 0" on reattach. That only worked because it was the
/// only caller. This records the actual parent — Panel (with its child index), Decorator or
/// ContentControl — and restores exactly that, so a preview nested behind other overlays comes
/// back in the same z-order it left from.
///
/// ⚠️ THE OWNER'S Closing REATTACHES FIRST. A detached preview is a live mpv render surface
/// parented to a different window. If the owner closed while it was still out there, the surface
/// would be torn down by whichever window happened to die first. Reattaching on the owner's
/// Closing puts it back in its home tree so the owner's normal disposal path runs unchanged.
