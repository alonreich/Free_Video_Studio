/// Navigation by process suicide. The user watched the app vanish from the taskbar and a
/// different window appear in its place, losing window focus, z-order and any state that was not
/// in the handoff payload. A failure to launch left them with nothing at all.
///
/// It also made an entire IPC subsystem load-bearing for something that is not inter-process:
/// <c>StateTransferStore</c> (21KB), <c>NamedPipeStateServer</c> (20KB), <c>IpcProtocol</c> (13KB)
/// and the crop config stores exist largely to carry state across a boundary that only existed
/// because the process exited.

/// and are preserved exactly:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>The video pipeline is still shut down</b> before the tool opens. mpv holds a D3D11
/// device, a libmpv IPC pipe and decoder threads; the Crop Tool and the Merger each start their
/// own. Two live pipelines contending for the GPU is the most likely reason the original author
/// reached for a process boundary in the first place, and nothing here re-introduces that.</item>
/// <item><b>The handoff payload is still written through <see cref="StateTransferStore"/>.</b> The
/// tool windows read their starting state from it on construction. Keeping that path means those
/// windows need NO changes for this to work — the process boundary goes away, the data contract
/// does not. Removing the IPC layer is a later, separate change with its own blast radius.</item>
/// <item><b>The launch state now travels as a typed in-memory record (TOOLNAV_05).</b> This class
/// used to serialise a <c>HandoffPayload</c> through <c>StateTransferStore</c> on
/// every open — a named-pipe/disk round trip to pass data between two windows of ONE process,
/// which is the Architectural Fix #3 boundary violation. The tool windows now receive a
/// <see cref="ToolLaunchContext"/> directly, and the return leg is an immutable
/// <see cref="ToolNavigationResult"/> handed back through the <c>onToolReturned</c> callback —
/// no <c>returned_from_crop_tool</c> sentinel in the persistent session state. The IPC handoff
/// API itself remains for the REAL cross-process return (a standalone tool process relaunching
/// the main app).</item>

/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>TOOLNAV_03 — the main window is HIDDEN, never closed.</b> Closing it would run the
/// deferred-close contract (05 §3), tear down the editor and discard the document session. Hiding
/// keeps the window, its view-models and its undo history alive and costs nothing, and the tool's

/// the user's session survives a trip to the Crop Tool.
