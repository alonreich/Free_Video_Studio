        // encode running on a file that would never be delivered, with the progress overlay already
        // gone" — and that entire backstop was unreachable code, because the only construction site
        // in the app (this method) let the instance fall out of scope on every exit path, success
        // and failure alike. The symptom users report (fans at full tilt, pegged CPU, nothing on
        // screen) is exactly what an undisposed worker produces when the setup path throws AFTER
        // RunAsync has been kicked off.
        //
        // `using` on the worker must be the OUTERMOST scope so Dispose runs strictly AFTER
        // `await tcs.Task` returns — disposing earlier would kill a process that had already
        // succeeded.
        //
        // The ct.Register handle was also being discarded. A discarded CancellationTokenRegistration
        // keeps its closure — and therefore the worker, and therefore the ProgressUpdate/PhaseUpdate/
        // Finished delegate chains that close over MainWindow's controls — rooted for the whole
