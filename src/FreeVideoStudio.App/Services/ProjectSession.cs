///
/// <para>
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// WHY THIS EXISTS — TWO DEFECTS, ONE CAUSE.
///
/// <b>1. The application could not save.</b> `ProjectDocument`, `ProjectSerializer`, `ProjectStore`
/// and `RecentProjects` were fully written, specified (06), and covered by ~370 lines of test —
/// and a grep for any of them across `src/FreeVideoStudio.App/` returned <b>nothing</b>.
/// There was no Save, no Open, no recent list and no autosave. A user who spent forty minutes on
/// speed ramps, memes and a music bed and closed the window lost all of it, with no prompt.
///
/// <b>2. Undo was three private implementations and one dead one.</b> `Core/Undo/UndoStack&lt;T&gt;`
/// was specified by 07 and tested, and never instantiated. `GranularSpeedEditorWindow` kept its own
/// `List`-based `_undoStack`/`_redoStack`; `CropToolWindow` had a third; and <b>`MainWindow` had no
/// undo at all</b> — no Ctrl+Z on the main timeline, where trims, cuts, memes and the music bed are
/// decided.
///
/// Both are the same cause: <b>there was no object that WAS the user's work.</b> State lived in
/// whichever window happened to own the control that produced it. This class is that object.
/// Everything else follows from it — you can save a document, you can keep a stack of documents,
/// and you can hand one to another window without serialising it through a named pipe.

/// `Capture()` is cheap and is called at edit boundaries, not per frame.
