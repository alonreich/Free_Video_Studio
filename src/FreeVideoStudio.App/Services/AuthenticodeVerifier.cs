/// UPDATETRUST_01 — Authenticode verification for a file this process is about to EXECUTE.
///
/// <para>
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. <c>UpdateService</c> downloaded an .exe, checked its SHA-256 against a digest
/// read out of the SAME GitHub JSON document that supplied the download URL, and then launched it
/// with <c>--install --auto-update</c> and <c>UseShellExecute = true</c> — i.e. elevated, with the
/// "preserve your settings?" question force-answered YES.
///
/// That hash proves TRANSPORT INTEGRITY and nothing else: it proves the bytes match what that JSON
/// claimed, not that we published them. Anyone able to produce that response body — a compromised
/// repo or CI token, a TLS-terminating corporate proxy, a mis-issued certificate — controls the
/// payload AND the fingerprint that validates it, in one move. The end state is attacker-supplied
/// code running as Administrator behind a single UAC click.
///
/// The verification primitive already existed on the OTHER side of the pipe: <c>build/FvsBuild/
/// CodeSigning.cs</c> Authenticode-signs the shipped binary and then runs <c>signtool verify /pa</c>
/// over it. Nothing on the RECEIVING side ever looked. This class is that missing half.
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>THE TRUST ANCHOR IS THE RUNNING PROCESS, NOT A HARDCODED THUMBPRINT.</b> A constant baked
/// into the source goes stale the day the signing certificate is renewed, and a stale pin fails
/// CLOSED — it would silently kill auto-update for every existing install until they manually
/// reinstalled. Instead the currently running executable is the anchor: it is already on the user's
/// disk, they already chose to run it, and it carries the publisher identity we want to stay with.
/// An update is accepted only when it is Authenticode-valid AND signed by the same publisher
/// subject as the binary asking for it.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>⚠️ UNSIGNED BUILDS — UPDATETRUST_02.</b> When the running process is itself unsigned there
/// is no anchor to compare against, so <see cref="EvaluateUpdateCandidate"/> returns
/// <see cref="TrustVerdict.NoAnchor"/>.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>That verdict is now a REFUSAL at the call site, not a fall-through.</b> It previously
/// degraded to hash-only "so nothing regresses for an unsigned distribution" — but the unsigned
/// distribution WAS production (see SIGNMANDATE_01 in <c>build/FvsBuild/CodeSigning.cs</c>), so the
/// degraded path was the only path that ever ran and the attack described at the top of this file
/// was never actually closed. <c>UpdateService</c> now deletes the download and tells the user to
/// install the signed build once by hand. <c>FVS_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_UPDATE=1</c> restores the old
/// behaviour for developers only.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// This class's verdict is unchanged and deliberately stays a three-way classification rather than
/// a bool: WHAT to do about a missing anchor is policy, and policy belongs with the caller that
/// owns the consequence, not with the primitive that reads the signature.
/// </para>
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Revocation is deliberately NOT checked</b> (<c>WTD_REVOKE_NONE</c>). A revocation lookup
/// needs network at exactly the moment the machine may have none left, and an offline CRL/OCSP
/// fetch fails in a way indistinguishable from a real revocation — which would reject legitimate
/// updates for offline users. Publisher pinning against the running binary is the stronger control
/// here: defeating it requires our actual signing key, which revocation would not have helped with
/// in the window before it was noticed.
