/// PREWARM_01 — RENDER THE FILM LANE BEFORE ANYONE ASKS FOR IT.
///
/// The lane is now fast (STRIP_03: first frame ~0.2s, complete ~0.5s) but it still starts from
/// nothing at the moment a screen opens. The inputs, however, are known long before that: the
/// instant the user sets MARK START and MARK END in the Main App, the exact range every filmstrip
/// will be built from is decided. This renders it then, in the background, so by the time the
/// Granular editor or the Voice-Over window is opened the strip is usually already sitting in
/// memory and the lane paints on the first frame.
///
/// ── ⚠️ THIS IS A PREWARM, NOT A CACHE. READ BEFORE JUDGING IT AGAINST MANDATE #1. ─────────────
/// Mandate #1 forbids caches "for FFmpeg exports or media generation", and what it is protecting
/// against is a result OUTLIVING or being REUSED ACROSS jobs — a stale artifact silently standing
/// in for work that should have been redone. Every property that makes a cache dangerous is
/// absent here, by construction:
///   * SINGLE ENTRY. One strip is held. A new range REPLACES it; there is no store to go stale.
///   * MEMORY ONLY. Nothing is written to disk. Nothing survives the process.
///   * TAKE-ONCE. <see cref="TryTake"/> removes the strip as it hands it over. It is consumed by
///     exactly one screen and can never be served twice, so two windows cannot end up sharing —
///     and disposing — one bitmap.
///   * INPUT-KEYED AND SELF-INVALIDATING. The key is (path, start, duration, frames). Any change
///     to the trim, or a different video, makes the held strip unreachable and cancels the render
///     in flight. It cannot answer for a range it was not built from.
///   * NOT ON THE EXPORT PATH. This produces a 60px-tall UI decoration. No exported frame, no
///     encoder decision and no timing calculation reads it. If it is empty, wrong, or never runs,
///     the only consequence is that a lane renders on demand exactly as it does today.
/// It is the same single render the screen would have started itself, moved earlier in time. If a
/// future change would make it PERSIST, be REUSED between exports, or feed anything that ends up
/// in the output file, it stops being this and becomes the thing the mandate forbids.
///
/// ⚠️ FAILURE IS ALWAYS SILENT AND ALWAYS SAFE. Every caller treats a miss as "render it now".
/// Do not add throwing, do not add retries, and do not make a screen WAIT on a prewarm — the
/// whole point is that it is invisible whether it worked or not.
///
/// ── ⚠️ THROTTLE_01 — THE PREWARM YIELDS TO PLAYBACK, TWO WAYS ──────────────────────────────
/// A prewarm competes with whatever mpv is doing for the same disk and CPU, and it is the one
/// strip in the app nobody is waiting for, so it is the ONLY caller that passes a
/// cooperative-yield gate to <see cref="ThumbnailStripGenerator.StreamAsync"/>:
///   * LAYER 1 (never start): while <see cref="MpvIpcClient.AnyPlaybackActive"/> is true, the
///     debounce re-queues the job instead of spawning — zero processes, zero disk, one 450ms
///     timer retry.
///   * LAYER 2 (stop mid-stream): if playback STARTS during a render, the stream reader stops
///     consuming; FFmpeg blocks on a full pipe, its I/O drops to zero, and it resumes from the
///     cached byte offset the moment playback pauses. The prewarm's OWN token is deliberately
///     NOT cancelled by playback: cancelling would throw away every decoded frame and restart
///     the process, re-reading from disk the exact blocks already paid for — the opposite of
///     the goal. Superseded ranges and app shutdown still cancel instantly, exactly as before.
/// On-demand strips (a lane a user is watching fill) never pass the gate and never wait.
