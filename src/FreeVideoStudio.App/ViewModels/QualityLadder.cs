/// QUALITY_01 — THE DIAL ASKS FOR QUALITY. THE FILE SIZE IS THE ANSWER, NOT THE QUESTION.
///
/// WHAT WAS WRONG. The quality wheel's value WAS a file size: `targetMb = 5 + idx * 5`, 5MB to
/// 100MB. The app then worked out the bits-per-pixel that size bought and told the user what it
/// had turned out to be — "Blurry-", "Sharp+". So the one thing a user actually cares about was
/// an OUTPUT of the control, and the only way to reach a quality they wanted was to guess a size,
/// read the verdict, and guess again.
///
/// It was worse than one round of guessing, because bits-per-pixel depends on DURATION. The same
/// 40MB is "Lifelike" on a ten-second clip and "Pixelated" on a three-minute one, so the slider
/// position meant something different in every project and the guessing started again each time.
/// That is precisely the "I have to keep fiddling with it" the complaint describes.
///
/// WHAT IT IS NOW. The wheel picks a TIER. The tier is a bits-per-pixel target, which is a
/// property of how the picture LOOKS and is independent of how long the clip is, so "sharp" is
/// the same sharp on a 10-second clip and a 3-minute one. The megabytes are computed from it and
/// shown, so the user still learns the cost — they just no longer have to solve for it.
///
/// ⚠️ THE EXPORT PIPELINE IS UNTOUCHED. It has always received a target-megabyte number
/// (`ProcessWorker`'s target size). This class computes that same number; nothing downstream of
/// the dial knows the difference. Do NOT "simplify" by passing a tier index into the encoder.
///
/// ⚠️ THE MATHS IS THE OLD MATHS, RUN BACKWARDS. Every line below is the inverse of what
/// ExportViewModel.UpdateEstimatedQuality used to do, including the 1.5 landscape divisor and the
/// 60fps basis. It is inverted rather than reinvented on purpose: the words users already know
/// ("sharp", "clear") keep meaning what they meant, and a calibration bug cannot be introduced by
/// a well-meaning rewrite of the model.
