/// AUDIT ROUND 5 — WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS
/// ======================================================================================
/// The routing used to be an if/else chain inside AvaloniaApp.Initialize that sniffed the
/// control's STYLE CLASSES. That coupled audio meaning to visual appearance, and the two do
/// not mean the same thing in this suite:
///
///   AUDIO_07  `Classes.Contains("Success")` -> the 1.385 s export-complete fanfare. Green is
///             this app's "forward action" colour, so that fanfare fired on NextBtn (a wizard
///             step advance), on YesBtn in two warning dialogs, on DownloadSongsBtn, on
///             SaveBtn... roughly ten times a session, always before anything was finished.
///             The Success branch is GONE. Process is now fired only by FinishedDialogWindow.
///
///   AUDIO_04  `Classes.Contains("Danger")` -> the 1.542 s "close" clip. But the suite's
///             destructive pattern is a red button whose ONLY job is to open a confirm flyout.
///             So you heard the sound of the thing being destroyed, were then asked whether to
///             destroy it, and heard the identical clip a second time on CONFIRM. Now handled
///             STRUCTURALLY: a Button that owns a Flyout has not done anything yet, so it gets
///             the short tick; the heavy clip belongs to the Confirm* button that commits.
///
///   AUDIO_10  `name == "UndoButton"` -> Close, while RedoButton matched nothing and got the
///             48 ms tick: a mirrored pair with wildly different audio. Neither is special
///             now, so both land on the same default tick. RdpFixButton APPLIES a system fix
///             but is styled red, so it used to sound like a cancellation; it is listed
///             explicitly below as an apply action.
///
///   AUDIO_11  `Classes.Contains("DangerOutline")` matched a class that exists nowhere in the
///             solution, and the `ProcessButton`/`SaveButton` name checks were already covered
///             by the Success class test on the same line - while `SaveBtn` (the one that
///             actually needed covering) was missing. All dead logic is gone.
///
///   AUDIO_09  The handler was registered on Button.ClickEvent only, so all 17 MenuItems in the
///             Main App and Merger were silent - including menu entries that are the SAME
///             action as a button that did make a sound (MenuVideoMerger vs VideoMergerButton).
///             This class resolves MenuItem too.
///
/// ORDER IS SIGNIFICANT. Read <see cref="Resolve"/> top to bottom. In particular the flyout
/// rule must run BEFORE any name list, because "CancelBtn" is used by BOTH SettingsWindow (a
/// harmless Secondary close) and MusicWizardWindow (a red flyout-guarded discard) - the two
/// can only be told apart structurally.
