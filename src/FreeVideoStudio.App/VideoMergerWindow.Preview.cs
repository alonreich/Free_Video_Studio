/// PREVIEWFAULT_01 — MPV PREVIEW STARTUP CANNOT CRASH THE PROCESS (Architectural Fix #2).
///
/// WHAT WAS WRONG. <c>InitializeMpv</c> was an <c>async void</c> implementation method whose first
/// awaited call <c>await _videoHost.StartMpvProcessAsync(mpvPath)</c> had NO catch anywhere on the
/// path: a faulted continuation escaped the async-void boundary into Avalonia's / AppDomain's
/// global unhandled handling and TERMINATED THE WHOLE APPLICATION for a preview-only failure
/// (missing native mpv binary, <c>mpv_create</c> returning null, <c>mpv_initialize</c> failing, or
/// IPC pipe setup failing).
///
/// WHAT THIS IS.
///   1. <see cref="MergerPreviewState"/> + <see cref="MergerPreviewGate"/>: one deterministic state
///      machine for the preview, extracted so its transition rules are unit-testable without a
///      dispatcher (MergerPreviewGateTests).
///   2. <see cref="StartPreviewInitialization"/>: one synchronous, duplicate-safe entry point — the
///      <c>Loaded</c> handler is NOT async anymore, so a re-firing Loaded, a retry while a start is
///      already running, or a close racing startup can never create a second host.
///   3. <see cref="RunPreviewInitializationAsync"/>: the old implementation body as a Task-returning
///      method with ONE COMPLETE try/catch from the first awaited native call onward. It never
///      throws; the fire-and-forget call site is therefore safe.
///   4. Window-lifetime cancellation (<see cref="_previewInitCts"/>): closing the window while
///      startup is in flight cancels it, the partially initialized view is disposed (MpvVideoView's
///      Dispose is idempotent and handles the resources created before a mid-flight fault), no
///      error modal is shown for the normal cancellation, and no control is touched after close.
