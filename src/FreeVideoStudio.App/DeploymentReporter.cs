/// ISSUE_2 (audit round 7) — THIS TYPE MUST NOT TOUCH THE LOG FILE DIRECTLY.
///
/// It used to call File.WriteAllText / File.AppendAllText on
/// <see cref="DeploymentFootprint.InstallReportPath"/>. That path is the SAME file RuntimeLog
/// writes to whenever the app is not running from the install directory (see RuntimeLog.LogPath).
/// Three separate faults followed:
///
///  1. No lock. RuntimeLog serialises every process through
///     Global\FreeVideoStudioLogMutex; these calls did not participate, so the two writers
///     raced. File.AppendAllText opens with FileShare.Read, which blocks RuntimeLog's writer from
///     opening the file for Write — RuntimeLog's batch then failed and was discarded, and a
///     rotation File.Move attempted in that window failed too.
///  2. No size cap and no rotation, so installer output bypassed the 10 MB ceiling entirely.
///  3. No error handling, and ResetAsync TRUNCATED the file. ResetAsync is called up to five times
///     in one install/uninstall flow (DeploymentLifecycle 75, 83, 103, 158, 229), so a single run
///     could wipe the user's application log repeatedly. Worse, an IOException from these writes
///     propagated out of AppendFatalAsync, which DeploymentLifecycle invokes from inside catch
///     blocks (846, 862, 889) — a failure to record an error could take the installer down while
///     it was reporting that error.
///
/// Everything now goes through RuntimeLog.AppendRaw, which inherits the shared mutex, the size
/// cap, rotation, retention and the never-throw contract. Console output is unchanged, and the
/// OnProgress event that drives DeploymentProgressWindow is unchanged.
