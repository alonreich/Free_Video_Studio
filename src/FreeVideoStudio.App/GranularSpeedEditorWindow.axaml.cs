    // move. Worse, the block's own length shifts everything after it, so the pointer and the block
    // chase each other.

    // The fix is a ruler that holds everything EXCEPT the meme being dragged: the speed segments,
    // the freeze, the cuts and every OTHER meme. That ruler is fixed for the whole gesture — the
    // only thing changing is the excluded meme's anchor — so "where did the user point" has a
    // stable answer from press to release.
    //
    // ⚠️ NOT BaseTimeline(). That one also drops the freeze, which is right for dragging the freeze
    // and wrong here: a meme must still be positioned relative to a freeze that exists.
