/// ======================================================================================
/// AUDIT ROUND 5 — WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (do not regress any of these)
/// ======================================================================================
/// AUDIO_05  The old throttle was a single 50 ms window compared against ONE remembered
///           buffer reference. Three of the six clips are 1.36-1.54 s long, so 50 ms was 3%
///           of the sound: spam-clicking restarted the clip ~10x/second and you heard only
///           chopped attack transients. Worse, because it remembered only the PREVIOUS
///           buffer, alternating between two different buttons reset it every time and it
///           never engaged at all. Now: a PER-CUE timestamp table, with each cue's window
///           derived from that clip's REAL decoded duration (clamped 80-350 ms), plus a hard
///           cap on simultaneous voices.
/// AUDIO_06  There was no volume and no mute, in an app with a whole "Sound and Music"
///           settings tab. Every play now passes through SettingsManager (UiSoundsEnabled /
///           UiSoundVolume).
/// AUDIO_12  Was System.Media.SoundPlayer -> winmm PlaySound, which is a SINGLE global
///           channel: two UI sounds could not overlap, a new one truncated the one before
///           it, and it offered no volume control at all (which is why AUDIO_05/06 had no
///           clean fix inside the old engine). Now NAudio - already a shipped dependency,
///           already used in production by Core\Media\VoiceRecorder.cs
///           - with a real mixer, so cues layer instead of cutting each other off. The
///           System.Windows.Extensions package reference was dropped from the csproj.
/// AUDIO_13  The old cache was a ConditionalWeakTable keyed on static readonly byte[] fields.
///           Static fields live for the whole process, so nothing could EVER be collected: it
///           was a permanent six-entry dictionary wearing a weak-cache costume, and the six
///           IDisposable SoundPlayers were never disposed. Now a plain fixed array plus a
///           real <see cref="Shutdown"/> wired to the desktop lifetime Exit event.
/// AUDIO_14  SoundPlayer.Play() parses the WAV synchronously if not already loaded, so the
///           first press of each cue did that work on the UI thread - for three clips over
///           119 KB - and Stop()/Play() ran while holding a lock on the UI thread. Decoding
///           and device I/O now happen entirely on the thread pool; the UI thread only does
///           an Interlocked timestamp compare.
/// AUDIO_08  Clips moved from base64 string literals in this file to EmbeddedResource .wav
///           assets (see the csproj). This file went from 650 KB to a readable one.
/// AUDIO_01  <see cref="Suppress"/> exists so the Voice Over Studio can hard-mute the whole
///           engine while the microphone is live.
/// ======================================================================================
///
/// FAILURE POLICY: never throw and never let a sound break a user action. If there is no
/// output device (VM, headless, RDP with audio redirection off - all real deployment targets
/// for this app per the PATH B notes) the engine disables itself permanently after one logged
/// warning and every Play call becomes a no-op.
