///   1. Build.cmd packaged only the program and its codecs — no media reached payload.zip.
///   2. The seeding code looked for an `mp3` folder FIVE LEVELS ABOVE the executable, which is
///      the DEV TREE layout (bin/Debug/net9.0-windows/win-x64 -> repo root). On a real machine
///      that path is nowhere, the fallback was the install directory which had no media either,
///      so every File.Exists() returned false and nothing was ever copied. Silently.
/// The starter media now ships in `starter\` NEXT TO THE PROGRAM, which exists identically in a
/// dev run and a real install — so `dev.cmd` finally rehearses production instead of being the
/// only place the feature worked.
