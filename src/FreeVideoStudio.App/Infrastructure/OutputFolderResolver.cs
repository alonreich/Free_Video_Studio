/// <summary>
/// ISSUE_04 — resolves WHERE a finished video is written, for each sub-application separately.
///
/// Resolution order (do not reorder):
///   1. The folder saved in settings for THIS app, if it still exists and is writable.
///   2. The user's REAL Downloads folder via <see cref="KnownFolders.GetDownloads"/> — this is
///      shell-resolved, so a moved Downloads folder, a OneDrive-redirected one, or a Group
///      Policy redirected one all resolve correctly. (The old code hardcoded
///      %USERPROFILE%\Downloads and was simply wrong on those machines.)
///   3. Only if neither is usable: ask the user to pick a folder ("Save As"). Whatever they
///      pick is SAVED as the new default for that app, so they are asked exactly once.
///
/// Hard rule: this never throws and never crashes the app when Downloads is missing. If the
/// user cancels the picker it returns null and the caller aborts the export cleanly with the
/// standard error dialog — it must not fall through into the pipeline with a null path.
