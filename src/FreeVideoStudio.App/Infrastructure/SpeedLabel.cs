/// SPEEDLABEL_01 — the one speed → (description, colour) ladder, and the label that renders it.
///
/// WHY THIS IS SHARED. <c>MainWindow.UpdateSpeedLabel</c> and
/// <c>VideoMergerWindow.UpdateSpeedLabel</c> were BYTE-IDENTICAL copies — same eight thresholds,
/// same eight descriptions, same eight hex colours, even the same <c>MainSpeedLabel</c> control
/// name. Two copies of the same ladder in two windows the user switches between.
///
/// ⚠️ THE LADDER IS A PRODUCT DECISION, NOT A FORMATTING DETAIL. "1.2x is a Slight Boost and it is
/// yellow" is a statement the app makes to the user about their edit. If the two copies drift —
/// and duplicated ladders drift, that is what they do — the SAME 1.2x clip is described one way in
/// the editor and another way in the merger, and the user is right to conclude the app does not
/// know what it is doing. One copy makes that impossible.
///
/// ⚠️ THRESHOLDS ARE BOUNDARY-INCLUSIVE AND ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE. Note that "Normal" uses
/// <c>&lt; 1.05</c> while every other rung uses <c>&lt;=</c>: the app's default speed is 1.1
/// (SpeedPresetButtons.NativeDefaultSpeed), so a strict bound is what keeps the default OUT of
/// "Normal" and in "Slight Boost". Do not tidy that into a uniform comparison.
