/// <b>WHY A HAND-WRITTEN ROOT AND NOT A DI CONTAINER.</b> An audit found <b>3 interfaces and 183
/// static mutable members</b> across ~90,000 lines, with every collaborator resolved by
/// <c>new</c>-ing it at its use site or by reaching for a static. That is the reason the App layer
/// has no tests: there is nowhere to substitute anything.
///
/// The obvious fix is <c>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</c>. It is rejected here for two
/// specific reasons, not out of preference:
///   1. <b>Mandate #1 — single binary, NativeAOT, <c>TrimMode=full</c>.</b> A container resolves by
///      <see cref="Type"/> at run time. Every resolution is a trim-analyser liability, and the
///      project's own <c>AOTSAFETY_01</c> block says warnings here are fixed, never muted.
///   2. <b>A container hides the graph.</b> This one is ~30 lines and can be read in full. When
///      the question is "what does MainWindow actually depend on", a file you can read beats a
///      registration list you have to execute.
/// Constructing everything explicitly costs one line per service and buys compile-time proof that
/// the graph is complete.

/// <b>⚠️ COMPOSITION_02 — <see cref="Current"/> IS A MIGRATION SHIM WITH A DELETION DATE.</b>
/// A static accessor is a service locator, and a service locator is the anti-pattern this class
/// exists to retire. It is here because ~25,000 lines of existing code-behind are constructed by
/// Avalonia's own lifetime and by XAML, neither of which can pass constructor arguments. Rewriting
/// all of that in the same change that introduces the root would make the change unreviewable.
///
/// The contract for the transition is therefore explicit:
///   • NEW code — every view-model, every service — takes its dependencies as CONSTRUCTOR
///     PARAMETERS. It must never touch <see cref="Current"/>.
///   • LEGACY window code-behind may read <see cref="Current"/> until its view-model is extracted.
///   • <see cref="Current"/> is DELETED at the end of the view-model extraction phase. The
///     architecture test <c>NoNewServiceLocatorUsage</c> holds the line by failing the build if the
///     number of call sites ever goes UP.
