/// MUSICSYNC_02 — ONE SLAVE-TO-THE-VIDEO RULE FOR EVERY PREVIEW AUDIO PLAYER.
///
/// The video (mpv time-pos, mapped to OUTPUT seconds through OutputTimeline) is the master clock.
/// Every other preview sound (voice-over takes on NAudio, the music bed on its own audio-only mpv)
/// follows it. Before this they each ran open-loop:
///   • voice-over takes on a default WaveOutEvent: 300 ms of buffering, compared against the
///     READER position (which runs ahead of what is audible by that buffering), and a 0.5 s
///     tolerance. A take could sit up to half a second off the picture before anything corrected it;
///   • the music bed never corrected at all during continuous playback.
///
/// The rule:
///   • Correct by SEEKING only. Never change a follower's playback RATE. Music and voice always
///     play at 1.0x. Only the video changes speed.
///   • Tolerance <see cref="DriftToleranceSec"/> (≈ 3 frames at 24 fps). A correction needs
///     <see cref="DriftStrikes"/> consecutive readings over tolerance, so tick jitter never
///     causes a seek.
///   • NAudio's reader runs <see cref="VoiceReaderLeadSec"/> ahead of the speaker. That lead is
///     subtracted before comparing, and added back when repositioning.
