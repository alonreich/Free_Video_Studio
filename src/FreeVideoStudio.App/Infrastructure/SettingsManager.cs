    //
    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // WHAT WAS WRONG, AND WHY IT WAS THREE BUGS, NOT ONE.
    //
    // This used to be:
    //     string tempFile = SettingsPath + ".tmp";
    //     File.WriteAllText(tempFile, json);
    //     File.Move(tempFile, SettingsPath, overwrite: true);
    //
    //   1. THE TEMP NAME WAS A CONSTANT. settings.json lives under ProgramDataRoot, which the Main
    //      App, the Video Merger (--merger) and the Crop Tools (--crop-tool) all share. Three
    //      processes writing "settings.json.tmp" is three processes writing the SAME scrap of
    //      paper. The loser gets IOException (swallowed, and 10 of the 12 call sites discarded the
    //      bool), or — worse — process B's File.Move publishes process A's half-written payload as
    //      the live configuration.
    //
    //   2. THERE WAS NO DURABILITY BARRIER. File.WriteAllText returns when the bytes reach the OS
    //      cache, not the platter, and File.Move maps to MoveFileExW with MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING
    //      only. NTFS journals the RENAME but not the DATA, so a power cut in that window leaves a
    //      correctly named, correctly sized, ZERO-FILLED settings.json. Load() then quarantines it
    //      and resets every preference the user ever set.
    //
    //   3. Instance WAS SERIALISED WITHOUT A LOCK. It is a mutable static reference object, and
    //      UpdateService's background task writes to it while UI handlers do. JsonSerializer walking
    //      a graph that is being mutated yields a torn document or InvalidOperationException.
    //
    // THE FIX, in the order the three defects are listed:
    //   1. A Global\ named mutex (SettingsMutexName) serialises the write across all three
    //      processes, exactly as CropConfigStore already does for crops_coordinations.conf.
    //   2. AtomicJsonFile.WriteText supplies the GUID temp name + FileOptions.WriteThrough +
    //      Flush(flushToDisk: true) + atomic File.Move that
    //      docs/05_SYSTEM_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md#SYS-RECOVERY mandates for ALL disk saves.
    //   3. The serialisation happens inside SerializeGate, so the JSON string is a consistent
    //      snapshot taken before any lock on the filesystem is contended for.
    //
    // SETTX_02 SUPERSEDES the original "mutex only around the write" rule: holding it only there
    // let a sibling process commit between our read and our write (lost update). The mutex now
    // spans the whole read-modify-write (see the LOCK ORDER block above); it is still never held
    // across a UI await and still uses the 2-second InteractiveMutexTimeout.
    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // SETTX_02 — the former public/private Save() is gone: every write now happens inside one
    // gate + named-mutex transaction (Update, or Load's own write-back), via TryWriteLocked/Update.
}
