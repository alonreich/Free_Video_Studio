/// MEME_07 — THE MEME CUTAWAY, SHOWN IN THE PREVIEW EXACTLY AS IT WILL BE EXPORTED.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The problem this solves.</b> A meme occupies ZERO source seconds and its whole length in
/// OUTPUT seconds, so <see cref="OutputTimeline.OutputToSourceRelative"/> answers every instant
/// inside the block with the anchor frame. That is mathematically right and visually useless: the
/// preview parked on one still while the finished video plays a whole meme, and the user could not
/// see what they had built until they exported it.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The approach (option B — one host, swap the file).</b> Every preview in this app is a single
/// <c>MpvVideoView</c> that owns a libmpv render context, a D3D11 device, WGL/DXGI interop and a
/// 16-texture shared swap chain. A SECOND one, layered over the first, would give a seamless
/// cutaway and would also double that stack in every window and add a disposal-ordering hazard to
/// four of them. So instead the ONE host is re-pointed: park the gameplay on the anchor frame,
/// load the meme, play it through, load the gameplay back at the same anchor frame, carry on.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The cost, and why it is announced rather than hidden.</b> Two <c>loadfile</c> round-trips per
/// meme, a few hundred milliseconds each, during which the picture is black. Hiding that would read
/// as a stutter or a crash. So each swap raises a blocking, unmissable overlay that says what is
/// happening and clears itself the moment the picture is live again. The user asked for exactly
/// this: stall visibly, then be flawless.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>⚠️ THE RULE EVERY HOST WINDOW MUST FOLLOW.</b> While this director is active, mpv is showing
/// the MEME, so <c>CurrentTime</c>, <c>Duration</c> and <c>IsEof</c> describe the meme file and NOT
/// the gameplay. Every consumer of those — cut-skip, trim-end-stop, music sync, voice-take sync,
/// the zoom crop updater, the end-of-video handler — would misfire. So the host's playback tick
/// must begin with:
/// <code>
///     if (_memePreview != null &amp;&amp; _memePreview.IsActive) { /* hold the caret */ return; }
/// </code>
/// That single early return is what makes this safe, and it is why the caret hold is the only
/// thing a host is allowed to do while a meme is on screen.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>What deliberately does NOT trigger a cutaway.</b> Only forward PLAYBACK crossing an anchor
/// does. Scrubbing, dragging the caret, and every programmatic seek are excluded — detected as a
/// jump larger than <see cref="SeekJumpSec"/> or a backwards move — because a cutaway that fired
/// while the user dragged the playhead would make the timeline impossible to scrub, which is the
/// opposite of the point.
