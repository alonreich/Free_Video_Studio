/// THEME_01 — THE ONE SAFE WAY TO PULL A BRUSH OR COLOUR OUT OF THE THEME FROM CODE-BEHIND.
///
/// ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS — READ BEFORE WRITING `FindResource` ANYWHERE.
/// `FindResource` DOES NOT RETURN NULL WHEN A KEY IS MISSING. It returns
/// <see cref="AvaloniaProperty.UnsetValue"/>, an instance of `Avalonia.UnsetValueType`. So this,
/// which reads like defensive code, is a live grenade:
///
///     Foreground = (IBrush?)Application.Current?.FindResource("AppTextMutedBrush") ?? Brushes.Gray;
///
/// The `?? Brushes.Gray` never runs. The CAST fires first and throws:
///     InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'Avalonia.UnsetValueType'
///                           to type 'Avalonia.Media.IBrush'
/// That exact line stopped the Video Merger from opening at all.
///
/// AND THE KEY MOST LIKELY TO GO MISSING IS A PERFECTLY GOOD ONE. Half of this app's brushes live
/// inside `ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries` in AvaloniaApp.axaml — AppSurfaceBrush,
/// AppPanelBrush, AppBorderBrush, AppTextPrimaryBrush, AppTextMutedBrush, AppControlTrackBrush and
/// friends. A theme-scoped resource can only be resolved against a THEME VARIANT. Ask without one,
/// or ask before the app's variant has settled during startup, and you get UnsetValue back for a
/// key that is sitting right there in the file.
///
/// THE RULES THIS CLASS ENFORCES:
///   (T1) Use `TryFindResource`, never `FindResource`. It reports failure instead of handing back
///        a sentinel that looks like a value and explodes at the cast.
///   (T2) Always pass a ThemeVariant, and prefer the CONTROL's over the Application's. A control
///        already attached to a window knows its own variant even while the app's is still
///        settling, and it also picks up any ThemeVariantScope it happens to sit inside.
///   (T3) Always take a fallback. A missing brush must degrade to a readable colour — never to a
///        crash, and never to an invisible control.
///
/// USAGE — pass the control that will DISPLAY the brush as the host:
///     status.Foreground = ThemeResources.Brush(status, "AppTextMutedBrush", Brushes.Gray);
