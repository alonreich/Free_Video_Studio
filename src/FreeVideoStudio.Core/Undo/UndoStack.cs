/// <para>
/// WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS: undo used to live in exactly one window. The Granular Speed Editor had a
/// genuinely good implementation — coalescing, de-duplication, a ceiling enforced on push, redo
/// invalidation — and the Crop Tool, Music Wizard, meme placement, the merger and the main window
/// had NOTHING. Worse, the editor's forty states were discarded the moment its window was accepted
/// or closed (04_UI_UX_AVALONIA_SPEC.md §6 UI-GRANULAR), so noticing a mistake five seconds too
/// late meant it was permanent.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// The four rules below are lifted DELIBERATELY from that editor's <c>PushUndo</c> rather than
/// reinvented. They were paid for in bug reports; this type generalises them to
/// <c>ProjectDocument</c> so every screen inherits the same behaviour instead of each growing its
/// own half-version.
/// </para>
///
/// <list type="number">
///   <item><description><b>U1 COALESCE A GESTURE.</b> A drag raises hundreds of changes. Entries
///   sharing a <c>gestureKey</c> within <see cref="GestureIdleMs"/> collapse into the ONE state
///   from before the gesture began, so a single Ctrl+Z undoes the whole drag — not one pixel of
///   it. The idle clock is refreshed even when the push is dropped, so the window tracks the LAST
///   movement and a slow drag never splits in two.</description></item>
///   <item><description><b>U2 CEILING ON PUSH.</b> The cap is applied as the entry goes on, so the
///   list can never exceed <see cref="MaxDepth"/> even briefly. Trimming afterwards leaves a window
///   where a snapshot of a large document is alive for no reason.</description></item>
///   <item><description><b>U3 A NEW EDIT BURNS THE REDO BRANCH.</b> Editing after undoing makes
///   every redo state unreachable history. Keeping them offers the user a "redo" that would
///   silently discard the edit they just made.</description></item>
///   <item><description><b>U4 NEVER PUSH A NO-OP.</b> If the new state equals the current one,
///   nothing happened. Growing the stack anyway produces the worst undo bug there is: a Ctrl+Z that
///   visibly does nothing, which users read as undo being broken and stop trusting.</description></item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>
/// ⚠️ <typeparamref name="T"/> MUST BE IMMUTABLE AND MUST HAVE VALUE EQUALITY. This holds a list of
/// states; if they are mutable, every entry is the same object and undo restores the present —
/// the defect the type exists to prevent. A C# <c>record</c> of value types and immutable
/// collections qualifies (<c>ProjectDocument</c> is exactly this). UI controls, bitmaps, streams
/// and IPC handles are forbidden, the rule UI-GRANULAR already states, generalised. U4 relies on
/// <see cref="object.Equals(object)"/> being a real state comparison — a reference-equality default
/// silently disables it.
/// </para>

/// ⚠️ NOT THREAD-SAFE, BY DESIGN. History is UI-thread state. Locking it would invite exactly the
/// dispatcher-blocking this codebase forbids (North Star #6). Call it from the dispatcher only.
