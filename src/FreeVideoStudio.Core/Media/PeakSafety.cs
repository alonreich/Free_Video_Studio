/// <para><b>1. THE PEAK TAMER (user switch: Settings › "Sudden loud moments").</b> A fast peak
/// compressor on the GAMEPLAY bus whose threshold sits <see cref="TamerHeadroomLu"/> above the
/// clip's own measured integrated loudness. The body of the gameplay never reaches it; only a
/// sudden burst far above the clip's average (an explosion, a scream) is pulled down. It runs on
/// the gameplay alone — never the summed mix — because a threshold derived from the GAMEPLAY's
/// loudness would otherwise squash a music bed that is simply mixed louder than the game.</para>
///
/// <para><b>2. THE SAFETY LIMITER (always on, no switch).</b> A true-peak brick wall on the final
/// mix at <see cref="SafetyCeilingDbtp"/>. It is 4x oversampled so it catches inter-sample peaks
/// (plain <c>alimiter</c> only sees sample peaks), and it carries <c>level=disabled</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>⚠️ <c>level=disabled</c> IS LOAD-BEARING. <c>alimiter</c>'s <c>level</c> (auto-level)
/// defaults to ON and rescales the output by 1/limit after limiting: the old
/// <c>alimiter=limit=-1.5dB</c> chain measured +1.5 dB LOUDER on everything with peaks back at
/// 0.0 dBFS (+1.0 dBTP). A limiter must never raise the level.</para>
