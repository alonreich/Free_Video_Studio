/// PIPELIFE_01 — THE ONE COPY OF "AN FFMPEG JOB'S LIFETIME".
///
/// <para>
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// WHAT THIS ENDS. <c>ProcessWorker</c> (172KB) and <c>MergerWorker</c> (69KB) are two independent
/// FFmpeg pipelines. Their filtergraph construction is genuinely different and stays separate —
/// that is not duplication, it is two different jobs. What WAS duplicated is the part that has
/// nothing to do with filtergraphs: owning the child process reference, the cancel flag, the
/// single-flight finish notification, and the teardown ladder.
///
/// That shared part had already drifted once, and the repository carries the receipts:
/// <c>PIPEDEDUP_01</c> notes that the twin <c>ReadExitCodeSafely</c> pair "silently diverged
/// between these two files", and <c>FFMPEGSTOP_01</c> notes that <c>ProcessWorker</c> "was a bare
/// WaitForExit -&gt; Kill(tree) -&gt; WaitForExit while the sibling copy in MergerWorker had
/// already been hardened". Each time, one twin was fixed and the other was not.
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/// <para>
/// <b>⚠️ PIPELIFE_02 — AND IT HAD DRIFTED AGAIN, IN THE SAME DIRECTION.</b>
/// <c>PROCGATE_01</c> fixed a use-after-dispose race in <c>ProcessWorker</c>: the process field was
/// read twice — once to null-test, once to act on — so the export thread could run
/// <c>_currentProcess = null; proc.Dispose();</c> in between, and the teardown then called
/// <c>Kill()</c> on a disposed <see cref="Process"/>. The fix was a lock-guarded gate with an
/// atomic take.
///
/// <c>MergerWorker</c> never received it. At the time of writing its <c>_currentProcess</c> is a
/// plain unsynchronised field, its <c>Cancel()</c> passes that field straight to the shutdown
/// ladder, and its <c>Dispose()</c> does exactly the two-read null-test-then-use the fix was
/// written to eliminate. Routing both through this type closes it in the Merger and makes a third
/// divergence impossible, because there is no longer a second copy to diverge.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>THREADING.</b> Every member is safe from any thread. <see cref="Cancel"/> is called from the
/// UI thread, cancellation-token registrations run on whichever thread cancelled, and the pipeline
/// itself publishes from a worker — all three touch the process slot, which is the entire reason
/// it is gated rather than volatile. A volatile field would give a consistent READ but still allow
/// two callers to both believe they own the disposal.
