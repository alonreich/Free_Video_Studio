/// mapped through OutputTimeline, the first track starts at the wizard's offset, following tracks
/// start at 0, and LOOP_01 repeats the list until the video is covered. The live preview did none of
/// that. It computed the song position from RAW SOURCE seconds and played one file, so it
/// disagreed with the export by the base speed (1.1x by default), by every cut and freeze before the
/// playhead, and completely after the first track ended. A beat lined up by ear in the preview then
/// missed in the export.
///
/// Both now read this plan. <see cref="Build"/> is the export's former inline loop, moved verbatim
/// in behaviour. <see cref="Locate"/> answers the preview's question against the same segments.

/// ⚠️ MUSIC SPEED IS ALWAYS 1.0x. The music bed is never time-stretched in the export and must never
/// be in the preview. Only the VIDEO changes speed. Preview sync is corrected by SEEKING the music,
