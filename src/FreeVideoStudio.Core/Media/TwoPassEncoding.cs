/// T01 — shared pieces of the two-pass size-targeting route, used by BOTH <see cref="ProcessWorker"/>
/// (Main App) and <see cref="MergerWorker"/> (Video Merger). Crop Tools never encodes video and has
/// no use for any of this.
///
/// ── WHAT TWO-PASS ACTUALLY DOES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Pass 1 encodes the whole timeline and writes a per-frame COMPLEXITY MAP. Pass 2 reads that map
/// and spends the SAME total bit budget where it is actually needed — taking bits from a static
/// lobby and giving them to a firefight. This is fundamentally different from `-rc-lookahead`,
/// which only sees ~32 frames (half a second at 60fps) and therefore can never make a trade
/// across the length of a clip.
///
/// Nothing in here touches pixels. No blur, no smoothing, no filter changes — only bit allocation.
///
/// ── WHERE IT APPLIES, AND WHERE IT MUST NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// (1) A BITRATE BUDGET MUST EXIST. Two-pass redistributes a fixed budget; CRF/CQ exports have no
///     budget, so a second pass costs time and changes nothing. Main App: the MB quality slider,
///     never ORIGINAL QUALITY. Merger: 100% "Lossless" only, never the CQ range below it.
/// (2) libx264 ONLY. `h264_nvenc` does not implement libavcodec's stats-file two-pass; its
///     equivalent is `-multipass` + `-rc-lookahead`, both already configured in
///     <see cref="EncoderManager"/> and explicitly not to be altered. Do not try to wire
///     `-pass 1`/`-pass 2` into the NVENC/AMF/QSV paths — FFmpeg will accept the flags and
///     silently ignore them, which is worse than not offering the feature.
///
/// ── THE SCRATCH MASTER AND MANDATE #1 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// A naive two-pass re-runs the ENTIRE filter graph for both passes, and in this codebase the
/// graph (14-18 way split, lanczos portrait scale, zoom pads, HUD overlays) dominates wall clock —
/// that costs ~2x. The FAST route renders the graph ONCE into a near-lossless master and points
/// both passes at that file: ~1.3-1.4x instead of ~2x.
///
/// ⚠️ `project_structure.txt` mandate #1 forbids caches for video pipelines. The master is NOT a
/// cache. It is created inside the job's own temp directory, consumed by the two passes, and
/// deleted in the same job — it is never reused across exports and never outlives the job folder.
/// Do NOT evolve it into anything that survives an export, and do not delete this feature on the
/// assumption that it violates the mandate.
///
/// When the staging drive cannot hold the master (see <c>DiskSpaceGuard.HasRoomFor</c>) callers
/// fall back to the SLOW route — the graph genuinely runs twice — rather than abandoning the
/// accurate size targeting the user asked for.
