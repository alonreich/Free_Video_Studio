/// <c>_cts.Dispose()</c>. At that instant TWO threads were still bound to <c>_cts.Token</c>: the
/// watchdog polling <c>IsCancellationRequested</c> on a 500 ms <c>Thread.Sleep</c> cycle, and the
/// seek processor suspended inside <c>ReadAllAsync(_cts.Token)</c> or <c>Task.Delay(..., token)</c>.
/// Freeing the source underneath live registrations makes those consumers observe
/// <see cref="ObjectDisposedException"/>, NOT <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/>.
///
/// The watchdog already guarded that case. The seek processor did not — and it was declared
/// <c>async void</c> and started from a raw <see cref="Thread"/>, so it had no
/// SynchronizationContext to rethrow onto. The exception surfaced on the thread pool as an
/// unobserved top-level throw, which under the .NET default policy FAST-FAILS THE PROCESS. A user
/// closing a window mid-scrub could lose the whole app with no managed stack anywhere.
///
/// Neither thread was joined either, so <c>_mpvHandle</c> could be commanded after its owner had
/// already destroyed it — a native access violation (0xC0000005) that no managed catch can contain.
///
/// THE FIX is the ordering <c>Ipc/NamedPipeStateServer.Dispose</c> already proves under
/// IPCTEARDOWN_01, plus the handle-ownership discipline <c>MpvIpcClient.Dispose</c> proves under
/// ISSUE_13: stop producing, signal, WAIT (bounded) for every consumer to actually exit, and only
