/// THE ONE PLACE THAT DECIDES WHICH CHIP ENCODES (issue 2).
///
/// Every application in the suite that exports video routes through this class. Before it existed
/// the Main App and the Video Merger reached the same decision by DIFFERENT routes:
///   * Main App  : Settings override -> boot hardware scan -> EncoderManager
///   * Merger    : hardcoded the literal string "GPU", ignoring both the user's Settings choice
///                 and the boot scan entirely
/// so the two apps could legitimately pick different encoders on the same machine, and the
/// documented "encoder selection chain" was only ever true for one of them.
///
/// RULE FOR ALL AI AGENTS AND HUMANS: an app must NEVER build its own strategy string. If a new
/// export surface is added, it calls <see cref="Resolve"/>. If the precedence needs to change, it
/// changes HERE, once, for everybody.

    /// PRECEDENCE (highest first):
    ///   1. An explicit Settings ▸ Performance choice ("NVIDIA" / "AMD" / "INTEL" / "CPU").
    ///      The user's word beats any probe, always. If the chosen encoder genuinely is not in the
    ///      bundled FFmpeg, EncoderManager surfaces a clear preflight error rather than quietly
    ///      doing something else.
    ///   2. The suite-wide boot scan result published by the Main App
    ///      (<see cref="HardwareCapability"/>), so the Merger and any future export surface reach
    ///      the SAME answer as the Main App without re-running a four-process ffmpeg probe.
    ///   3. <see cref="HardwareScanner.ScanFailed"/> when nothing is known. This is NOT "CPU" —
    ///      EncoderManager treats it as "unknown, re-probe at export time" and recovers to
    ///      hardware if its own `ffmpeg -encoders` probe finds any. Returning "CPU" here is the
    ///      exact bug that made a machine with a working RTX export everything on libx264.
