/// MUSICPAD_01 — THE MUSIC LANDS WHERE THE PINK NOTES SAY, EVEN WITH FADES ON.
///
/// The Main App places the music in OUTPUT seconds measured from MARK START (OutputTimeline with the
/// trim start as origin — the same clock the preview plays). But the exported body does NOT start at
/// MARK START: with fades on, ProcessWorker extracts up to 1 s of footage BEFORE it (the fade-in pad,
/// <c>padStartHumanSec</c>) and the music is mixed into that padded body. Every track therefore
/// started — and ended — exactly one pad EARLY in the file compared to the preview (measured: onset
/// 1.923 s instead of 2.918 s on a 3–9 s trim at 1.1x). Voice-over takes were already measured from
/// the padded start; music was not.
///
/// <see cref="Align"/> moves every track by the lead pad, so the song meets the video on exactly the
/// frames the preview showed. Two edge refinements keep "music from the beginning / to the end" full:
///   • LEAD — the first track starts on MARK START and the lead fade is on: it pre-rolls into the
///     fade-in pad from earlier in the song (as far as the song has room before its start point),
///     so the song is still in sync with the video AND fills the fade-in.
///   • TAIL — the bed reaches MARK END and the tail fade is on: the last track runs on through the
///     fade-out pad (its own fade-out then ends with the picture).
/// Pure; unit-tested.
