/// RESCUE_01 — moves a finished render out of a failing pipeline and into the temp root under a
/// name that is RESERVED, not merely observed to be free.
///
/// WHAT WAS WRONG. <c>ProcessWorker.TryRescueFinishedRender</c> and
/// <c>MergerWorker.TryRescueFinishedRender</c> were two byte-identical copies of this shape:
/// <code>
///     while (File.Exists(rescued)) { rescued = $"...-{n}.mp4"; n++; }
///     File.Move(corePath, rescued);
/// </code>
/// That is precisely the defect <c>ProcessWorker.ResolveOutputPath</c> documents under OUTPATH_01
/// and was rewritten to remove — "a File.Exists scan: check, then return the name, then write to
/// it much later. Two pipelines running at once ... both saw the same index free". The rescue
/// path never received that fix, and the consequence here is STRICTLY WORSE than it was for
/// ResolveOutputPath:
///
///   1. <c>ResolveOutputPath</c> feeds a <c>File.Move(..., overwrite: true)</c>. The rescue called
///      the TWO-argument <c>File.Move(string, string)</c>, which THROWS <see cref="IOException"/>
///      when the destination exists. The throw was caught, null was returned, and the finished
///      render — the ONLY copy, which is the entire reason it is being rescued — was abandoned on
///      a path the failing pipeline was about to clean up. A completed export, lost silently, with
///      one log line as the only trace.
///   2. The name is stamped to ONE SECOND (<c>yyyyMMdd-HHmmss</c>) and the temp root is shared by
///      every process. Cancel-then-restart — the scenario OUTPATH_01 was written for — and Main
///      App + Merger running together both put two rescues inside the same second.
///   3. The <c>n</c> loop had NO CEILING, unlike ResolveOutputPath's. On a directory where
///      File.Exists keeps returning true (permissions, a full disk, an offline share) it spun
///      forever INSIDE A FAILURE HANDLER.
///
/// ⚠️ ONE COPY, ON PURPOSE. The two workers previously held two copies of this method and two
/// copies of <c>ReadExitCodeSafely</c>; the latter pair silently DIVERGED (one was hardened to
/// use GracefulProcessTerminator, the other was left calling Kill raw). Anything that both
/// pipelines do identically belongs here, once, so a fix cannot miss a caller.
///
/// ⚠️ THE PREFIX AND LOG TAG ARE PARAMETERS, NOT CONSTANTS. "FreeVideoStudio-RECOVERED-" and
/// "Merged-Videos-RECOVERED-" are user-visible and tell the user which tool produced the file;
/// "Merged-Videos-RECOVERED-" (<see cref="OutputFileNaming"/>) are user-visible and tell the user which tool produced the file;
/// "Output" and "Merger" are how crash digests attribute the failure. Both must stay distinct.
