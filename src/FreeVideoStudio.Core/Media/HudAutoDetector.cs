/// MAGICWAND_02 — AUTOMATIC HUD DETECTION. THE C# PORT OF THE OLD PYTHON TOOL'S magic_wand.py.
///
/// WHAT THE BUTTON USED TO DO, AND WHY IT WAS HIDDEN.
/// <c>CropToolWindow.ShowMagicWandCandidates</c> drew six rectangles at hardcoded fractions of the
/// frame — 0.65, 0.02, 0.32, 0.28 and five more like it — and presented them as detections. On any
/// capture whose HUD did not happen to sit at those fractions it was confidently, silently wrong,
/// which is worse than absent, so MAGICWAND_01 hid the button rather than delete a handler someone
/// might one day back with a real analyser. This is that analyser.
///
/// WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, in the order it does it:
///   1. Samples frames uniformly across the WHOLE clip (not the single frozen frame — see below).
///   2. Takes the per-pixel TEMPORAL MEDIAN. Gameplay moves; the HUD does not. The median of sixty
///      frames spread over a match is a picture of the parts of the screen that never change.
///   3. Takes the per-pixel TEMPORAL STANDARD DEVIATION and inverts it into a stability mask, so
///      "this pixel never changed" becomes a first-class, scoreable signal.
///   4. Builds three more masks off the median: an adaptive threshold (dark HUD plates on bright
///      gameplay), Canny edges (panel borders), and an HSV colour-anchor mask tuned to the four
///      colour families a Fortnite HUD actually uses — health green, shield blue, loot amber,
///      rarity purple/pink.
///   5. For each of the five known HUD roles, looks ONLY inside that role's zone of the screen,
///      finds connected blobs, filters them by size and aspect, and scores the survivors on eight
///      weighted terms. Non-maximum suppression keeps the best one or two per role.
///   6. Falls back to a generic detector if fewer than three roles were found, and to a Hough
///      circle hunt if the minimap specifically was missed.
///
/// WHY IT ANALYSES THE CLIP AND NOT THE SNAPSHOT. The snapshot is one frame. One frame cannot tell
/// a HUD panel from a wall, because both are just pixels; it is the fact that the panel is STILL
/// THERE sixty frames later that identifies it. The old Python tool took the snapshot path as an
/// argument too and then ignored it for exactly this reason (<c>extract_all(snapshot_path, ...)</c>
/// reads <c>params["input_file"]</c>), and so does this. The snapshot's DIMENSIONS are what matter,
/// and those come in as <c>sourceWidth</c>/<c>sourceHeight</c>.
///
/// WHY THERE IS NO OpenCV. Invariant 1 in docs/README.md is the Single Binary Executable Mandate.
/// The primitives OpenCV supplied — adaptive threshold, morphology, contours, Canny, Hough — are
/// implemented in <see cref="HudImageOps"/>, which documents each one against the call it replaces
/// and every place the two differ.
///
/// COORDINATE SPACES. There are two, and mixing them is the classic way to break this file:
///   • ANALYSIS space: every mask, blob and pixel index, 540 rows tall by construction.
///   • SOURCE space: what the caller gets back, in the snapshot's own pixels.
/// <see cref="ScaledToSourceRect"/> is the ONLY crossing point. Nothing else may convert.
///
/// THREADING. Pure computation with no UI types; call it from a background task. It honours the
/// cancellation token between every stage and inside the frame reader.
