/// WHY THIS EXISTS. An audit of <c>src/</c> counted <b>917 catch blocks in ~90,000 lines</b> — one
/// per 98 lines — of which 368 were bare <c>catch (Exception)</c> and 391 sites carried a comment
/// saying "best-effort" or "ignore". The near-universal shape was:
/// <code>
///     try { ... } catch (Exception ex) { RuntimeLog.Fail("AREA", ex); }
/// </code>
/// That is not error handling. It is error <i>absorption</i>: a log line the user will never open,
/// followed by the program continuing as though nothing happened. A failed thumbnail, a failed
/// ffprobe and a failed settings write all present identically to the person using the app —
/// as <b>nothing happening</b>. The user is left to guess whether they mis-clicked.
///
/// Silence is the one response that must not be available. Every catch block now answers one
/// question — <i>what does the person in front of this window need to know?</i> — and the three
/// possible answers are the three members of this enum.
