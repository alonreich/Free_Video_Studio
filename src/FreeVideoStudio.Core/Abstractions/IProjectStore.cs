/// <b>WHY AN INTERFACE OVER A PERFECTLY GOOD STATIC CLASS.</b> <c>ProjectStore</c> is a static
/// class that touches the real filesystem. Every view-model that needs to save therefore drags the
/// disk into its own tests, and "what does the UI do when the save fails" — the case that actually
/// matters, because it is the one the user must be told about — becomes untestable without
/// contriving a read-only directory.
///
/// The implementation (<c>FileProjectStore</c>) is a thin forward to the existing static methods.
/// The atomic-write protocol, the <c>.bak</c> cascade and the amputation rule all stay exactly
/// where they are, in <c>ProjectStore</c>/<c>ProjectSerializer</c>, governed by spec 06. This
/// interface adds a seam; it does not add a second implementation of the protocol, and it must
/// never be allowed to grow one (<c>05_SYSTEM_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md</c> §4c: "Never reimplement this
/// sequence at a call site").
