/// that reach <see cref="IFaultSink"/>. That is not negligence. It is arithmetic. Reporting a
/// fault requires an <see cref="IFaultSink"/> instance; the code that catches exceptions is
/// overwhelmingly static helpers and window code-behind that Avalonia constructs, neither of which
/// has a constructor anyone can pass one to. So the conversion needed a plumbing change per call
/// site, and a 900-site plumbing change does not get done — which is exactly the outcome the

/// category as <c>RuntimeLog</c> and <c>CoreLogger</c>, both of which are already static by
/// deliberate decision and are not on anyone's list to inject. A failure must be reportable from
/// anywhere, including from a static utility, a finaliser and a thread with no object graph in
/// scope. Making that channel reachable is what allows the silence to end.
