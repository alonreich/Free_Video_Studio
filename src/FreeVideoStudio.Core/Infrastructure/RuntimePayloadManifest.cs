/// <para>
/// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
/// <b>THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS TO MEASURE.</b> The product ships as one 322 MB executable: a
/// NativeAOT installer with <c>payload.zip</c> embedded as a managed resource, which it extracts on
/// first run. The payload is FFmpeg and libmpv — <c>avcodec-62.dll</c> alone is 97 MB — plus the
/// starter media. The application's own code is a small fraction of that.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// ⚠️ <b>AND THE AUTO-UPDATER DOWNLOADS ALL OF IT, EVERY TIME.</b> <c>UpdateService</c> fetches the
/// single <c>FreeVideoStudio.exe</c> release asset and reinstalls. So a one-line typo fix
/// costs every user 322 MB over a 30-minute timeout — for a set of codec DLLs that have not changed
/// since June and will not change in this release either. On a metered connection that is a reason
/// to stop updating, which turns every shipped fix into a fix most users never receive.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>WHAT THIS CLASS DOES.</b> It records a fingerprint of the runtime payload — the binaries, not
/// the app — next to the installed files. The build writes one into the payload; the updater
/// compares the installed fingerprint against the one the release advertises. Equal means the
/// runtime is already correct on this machine and only the application needs to come down.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// ⚠️ <b>NAMES AND SIZES, NOT CONTENT HASHES.</b> Hashing 368 MB of DLLs on every startup to
/// decide whether to check for an update would be a worse bug than the one being fixed. Name plus
/// exact byte length over the whole set is enough to notice a version change — FFmpeg builds do not
/// coincidentally keep every file at exactly the same length — and it costs a directory listing.
/// The downloaded package is still verified by SHA-256 before it is trusted (UPDATETRUST_02); this
/// fingerprint decides WHAT to download, never whether to trust it.
