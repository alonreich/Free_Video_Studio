/// ISSUE_07 — shared helper for the ONE remaining legitimate use of a joined command string:
/// writing a copy-pasteable line into the DEBUG log.
///
/// BACKGROUND. Every FFmpeg/FFprobe invocation in this codebase must be launched through
/// <c>ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList</c>, never through a hand-assembled <c>Arguments</c> string.
/// The old hand-built strings only wrapped an argument in quotes when it contained a SPACE, so:
///   * a path containing a double-quote broke the command line outright, and
///   * a path ending in a backslash escaped its own closing quote and swallowed the next argument.
/// Either way the user got an inscrutable FFmpeg error with no clue that their FOLDER NAME was
/// the cause. <c>ArgumentList</c> applies the real Windows CreateProcess escaping rules per
/// argument and removes the whole class of bug.
///
/// The formatted string produced here is for HUMAN EYES ONLY. It must never be fed to
/// <c>ProcessStartInfo.Arguments</c>.
/// </summary>
