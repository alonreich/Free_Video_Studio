/// PIPEDEDUP_01 — the single-flight gate around <see cref="GracefulProcessTerminator"/>, and the
/// one place the "stop an FFmpeg child safely" mechanics are written down.
///
/// WHAT WAS WRONG. <c>ProcessWorker</c> and <c>MergerWorker</c> run structurally identical FFmpeg
/// pipelines and each held its OWN copy of this logic: the same `_shutdownGate` /
/// `_shutdownTarget` / `_shutdownTask` triple, the same <c>BeginCooperativeShutdown</c>, the same
/// <c>AwaitActiveShutdownAsync</c>, the same <c>ReadExitCodeSafely</c>.
///
/// ⚠️ THAT DUPLICATION IS NOT A STYLE COMPLAINT. IT HAS ALREADY SHIPPED TWO DEFECTS:
///   1. FFMPEGSTOP_01 — <c>ReadExitCodeSafely</c> existed in both files with the same name, the
///      same signature and the same doc comment. MergerWorker's was hardened to route through
///      <see cref="GracefulProcessTerminator"/>; ProcessWorker's was left calling
///      <c>Kill(entireProcessTree: true)</c> raw. The PRIMARY export path therefore shipped with no
///      cooperative FFmpeg shutdown at all, producing unplayable MP4s (no moov atom) on cancel,
///      while the secondary path had the fix.
///   2. RESCUE_01 — <c>TryRescueFinishedRender</c> was a byte-identical copy in both files, and
///      both carried a File.Exists-then-File.Move race plus an unbounded index loop that the
///      neighbouring <c>ResolveOutputPath</c> already documented as a fixed defect.
///
/// Every future fix to either pipeline had a coin-flip chance of landing in only one copy. One
/// copy, here, is what stops that.
///
/// ⚠️ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* UNIFIED. The two RunAsync pipelines are different jobs — the
/// editor export applies trim/cuts/speed/memes/overlays/voice-over to ONE source, the merger
/// concatenates N sources with normalisation. Only the PROCESS MECHANICS live here. Log tags and
/// the quit-command policy stay caller-supplied, because they genuinely differ per pipeline and
/// crash digests are read by tag.
